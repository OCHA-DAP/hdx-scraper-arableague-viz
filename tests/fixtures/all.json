On entry, visitors are granted leave to enter for a period of up to 3 months. <br>\nVisitors entering via Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport are given an entry card instead of an entry stamp in their passport. While this practice is in place at other ports of entry, there have been instances where passports have been stamped for entry purposes. You should keep your entry card with your passport until you leave. This is evidence of your legal entry into Israel and may be required, particularly at any crossing points into the Occupied Palestinian Territories. If you\u2019re refused entry into Israel, your passport may be stamped with an entry stamp and two red lines drawn across it to indicate the refusal. <br>\nIt is for the Israeli authorities to determine the right of entry into Israel, if you have any particular concerns about visas or entry into Israel. If you work in Israel without the proper authority, you can be detained and then deported, a process which could take several months. Consular staff will not be able to help you enter Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories. They are unable get involved in another country\u2019s immigration policy or procedures. <br>\nAt the Allenby Bridge crossing with Jordan, as well as at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport, Israeli border officials have on occasions used an entry stamp for certain travellers that states \u2018Palestinian Authority only\u2019 or \u2018Judea and Samaria only\u2019. Since travellers entering via the Allenby Bridge crossing must pass through Israeli checkpoints and Israeli-controlled territory to reach Jerusalem or Gaza, this restriction effectively limits travellers who receive this stamp. It is not clear how a traveller receiving the stamp at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport can leave the airport without violating the restriction. This stamp has been issued to travellers who have no Palestinian or other Arab ancestry, and who would not seem to have any claim to a Palestinian Authority ID. <br>\nIsraeli border officials at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport have also at times required certain travellers to sign a form that states that he/she is not allowed to enter territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority unless he/she obtains advance authorisation from the Israeli \u2018Territory Actions Co-ordinator\u2019, and that violating this restriction may result in the traveller being deported from Israel and barred from entry for up to 10 years. In March 2017 the Israeli Parliament passed a law which gives authority to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott. <br>\nEmergency Travel Documents: Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories unless the holder is a returning resident. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Israel. <br>\nPrevious Travel to Other Countries: Evidence of a previous visit to another country in the region like an entry/exit stamp in your passport does not normally prevent entry into Israel, although it may lead to additional questioning at the border. It is for the Israeli authorities to determine the right of entry into Israel, so if you have any particular concerns about previous travel to another country, you should contact the Israeli embassies . <br>\nCustoms and Immigration: You should expect lengthy personal questioning and baggage searches by security officials on arrival and departure from Israel. Electrical items, including laptops, may be taken from departing passengers for security inspection and either stored in the aircraft baggage hold, or returned to your country. Damage may occur. <br>\nIf you arrive with valuable personal items (computers, camcorders etc.) you may be required to pay a deposit that is refundable on or after departure. <br>\nIsraeli security officials have on occasion requested access to travellers\u2019 personal e-mail accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of entry. <br>\nEntry to the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs), including by sea to Gaza, is controlled by the Israeli authorities. You must produce a passport and immigration slip, to cross between Israel and the OPTs. <br>\nYou may be detained on arrival and deported if you are intending to enter Gaza without permission. If you\u2019re entering the country for the purpose of working in the OPTs, you may be refused entry. For more information, contact the nearest Israeli Embassy.<br>\nDual nationals: dual nationals living in the West Bank and Gaza are allowed to travel abroad only via the Rafah or Allenby Bridge border crossings into Egypt or Jordan and return via the same route. <br>\nChildren with Israeli parents (father and/or mother) are considered to be Israeli nationals. The Israeli Ministry of Interior insists that these children enter and leave Israel on an Israeli passport.<br>\nIf you\u2019re fully vaccinated: If you\u2019re fully vaccinated, you can enter to The Occupied Palestinian Territories. <br>\nNon-Israeli citizens will need to present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours before the flight to Israel. These tests must be performed by a professional test lab in the origin country and should state the full name and passport number of the passenger.
