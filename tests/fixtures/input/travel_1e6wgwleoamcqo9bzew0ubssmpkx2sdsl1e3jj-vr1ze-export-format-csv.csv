*Travel in Afghanistan: Healthcare in Afghanistan is very limited. Medical facilities, including those in Kabul, do not have the capacity or capability to effectively deal with the COVID-19 outbreak. The supply of ICU beds and ventilators is low. There are areas which have no medical facilities with ICU beds and ventilators.<br>
There is no guarantee that any local health care will be available in the current security situation. Whilst an estimated 30 per cent of the population had been exposed to COVID-19 by June 2020, WHO warns that widespread complacency and failure to follow public health advice is creating grave risks in the community with people generally not observing physical distancing or mask-wearing protocols.

You should read these before your departure and monitor the pages on a regular basis as the requirements may change at short notice. Masks should be worn at all times during your travel to Barbados and your passage through the airport. Social distancing and hygiene protocols are in place. <br>
*Arrive with a COVID 19 negative test: All travellers must present on arrival either: <br>
•        a valid RT-PCR COVID-19 negative test result taken no more than 3 days in advance of your flight’s arrival. Please note that the test can be taken at any time during the day 3 days prior to the date of your arrival in Barbados. (For example, if your flight arrives at 10pm on Saturday, you can take a test at any time on the Wednesday prior to this) <br>
•        a valid Rapid PCR COVID-19 negative test result taken one day before arrival in Barbados <br>
•        a valid Rapid Antigen negative test result taken one day before arrival in Barbados <br>
Accepted tests include tests which were taken at an approved or recognised laboratory by a healthcare provider via a nasopharyngeal sample, oropharyngeal sample, nasal sample, anterior nares samples or mid-turbinate sample. Your test certificate should provide this information. LAMP tests, shallow nasal swab samples, self-administered tests or home kits or tests using saliva samples will not be accepted. Relevant test accrediting bodies and standards authorities include: ISO 15189, CAP, UKAS or the equivalent. You should check the protocols to confirm and understand all requirements. All passengers are also required to submit an Embarkation/Disembarkation (ED) card 24 hours prior to travel, to which they should upload their negative test result via 
<a href=""https://www.travelform.gov.bb/home"">Travel Form</a>. The BIMSafe app can also be used. <br>
If you arrive in Barbados without a valid negative COVID test, you may be denied entry to the country. You should arrange to take a private test. On arrival all passengers are also subject to a health screen. <br>
If you have recovered from recently diagnosed COVID-19 and your pre-flight PCR test is still positive, you should bring a letter from your medical practitioner with lab test results showing the date of diagnosis and recovery. You may be obliged on arrival to complete an assessment at one of the government isolation facilities for up to 48 hours before being released from quarantine. <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Barbados will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Fully vaccinated arrivals: Fully vaccinated persons (2 doses administered more than 14 days prior to arrival) will not be subject to testing* or quarantine on arrival. Once you have completed a health check and your documentation (valid negative test and proof of vaccination status) has been validated, you will be free to move around Barbados unhindered. <br>
A number of fully vaccinated arrivals will be randomly chosen to have a rapid antigen test. There is no requirement to quarantine, as the result will be made available very quickly. See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a> for further details. <br>
Details of what the Barbadian authorities will accept as proof of vaccination can be found in the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a>. If you are unable to provide sufficient proof that you have been vaccinated then you will be treated as if you are unvaccinated. <br>
*Quarantine for unvaccinated arrivals: Unvaccinated arrivals will be quarantined at approved facilities (a designated holding hotel, approved villa or a government facility at your own expense) and undergo a second PCR test 4 days after arrival. You will need to remain in your hotel room and may be required to wear an electronic tracking bracelet until you receive the results of your second test. The government aims to return results within 48 hours, although return times can sometimes be longer than this. If the result of that second test is negative, you will not be subject to further quarantine. The government recommends that you book 5 nights’ accommodation. See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2021"">Barbados Travel Protocols  </a> for full details.
*Testing positive for / close contact with COVID-19 in Barbados: If you test positive for COVID-19 at any point during your stay in Barbados you will be required to self-isolate. You will first be assessed by a member of staff from the government isolation facilities for 24 hours. You may be transferred to the Government’s quarantine facility, Harrison’s Point, for further assessment and treatment. You can stay there for no cost until you have recovered. Conditions at the government quarantine facilities are generally basic and not necessarily equivalent to a tourist hotel with the associated services. <br>
Alternatively, you may be eligible for the Government’s home isolation programme and you have the option of requesting to self-isolate at your hotel, apartment or villa, or government approved isolation property under strict stipulations that must be signed and adhered to. This will be at your own expense. You will need to remain at your designated accommodation until the Barbadian authorities are satisfied that you have recovered. This may mean a mandatory stay of several weeks in Barbados. Upon recovery, tourists can continue their holiday or return home. The option to self-isolate in an approved hotel, villa or property is not a right – the decision will be made by healthcare professionals. See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols  </a> for full details of isolation options, facilities and requirements.
If you are deemed to have been in close contact with a positive COVID-19 case, you will be required to quarantine at approved facilities. See <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020""Barbados Travel Protocols></a> for full details.

Transiting: If you are in a bordering country and need to cross the land border to board a flight back to your country of residence, you should get in touch with the British Embassy or Consulate. You will be permitted to enter Brazil with authorisation from the Federal Police following an official request from the Embassy and on presentation of flight tickets. You should travel straight to the airport once in Brazil. <br>
*Sea ports: Following a recommendation from the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), the Brazilian Government has temporarily suspended domestic cruise ships from operating along the Brazilian coast. Given the fluid coronavirus situation globally, such cruises are likely to remain subject to disruption at short notice throughout 2022. <br>
The Brazilian government continues to suspend the entry of all international cruise ships and prohibits most foreigners from disembarking at any port or other maritime location in Brazil regardless of nationality. These restrictions do not apply to resident foreigners and foreign spouses, children, parents or custodians of a Brazilian national. Disembarkation will only be permitted when medical assistance is required or to catch a connecting flight back to the passenger’s country of residence. <br>

There are additional local requirements to show proof of vaccination in order to access certain places, such private venues, including hotels, restaurants and gyms. The precise requirements may vary from venue to venue so you should check on compliancy requirements in advance. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels are operating at capacities dictated by local rules and regulations.<br>

Internations Restrictions:<br>
 *Entry to Cameroon: There are multiple commercial flight options to enter and leave Cameroon. Access across Cameroon’s land and sea borders is currently restricted due to COVID-19. <br>
Travel requirements to enter and exit Cameroon can change without notice and without proactive communication. The Centre for the Coordination of Public Health Emergency Operations conditions of entry and exit to Cameroon <a href=""https://www.ccousp.cm/urgences-sanitaires/Fcovid-19/condition-dentree-et-sortie-au-cameroun/"">website </a> is the best source of the latest information. <br>
Requirements apply: <br>
You must have proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before first boarding) negative coronavirus PCR test to board your flight to Cameroon and to enter at Yaoundé or Douala Airports. <br>
The Government of Cameroon demands a negative Coronavirus PCR test from all travellers aged five and above. (Some airlines demand a PCR test from travellers aged two and above, so check with your airline.) <br>
Your negative coronavirus test result should be in PDF format, clearly stating the date of the test and the type of test (which should be PCR). Electronic copies are accepted.You should arrange to take a private test. <br>
*Testing/screening on arrival: All international travellers are subjected to extra, rapid flow, testing for Coronavirus on arrival at Yaoundé and Douala international airports. This is the Rapid Flow test. At present this includes all passengers arriving in Cameroon. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee. <br>
This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative PCR test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: If you have a proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at Yaoundé or Douala airport will be held for further enquiries to trace contacts and movements. We believe that anyone testing positive can quarantine at the location of your host or private accommodation until a negative PCR test is produced. These requirements are regularly evolving. <br>
*Exit Requirements: All travellers leaving Cameroonian territory must present a negative PCR or a rapid flow test result at the airport from the last 72 hours. We strongly advise that you take a PCR test, with a QR barcode. Your country of destination or transit may have other requirements. <br>

Adults travelling with fully vaccinated children between the ages of 5 to 11 have the option to upload their proof of vaccination into ArriveCAN.<br>

All travellers need to <a href=""https://www.c19.cl/"">complete an affidavit</a> (Declaración Jurada) up to 48 hours before boarding. This will generate a QR-code document (sent by e-mail), which you must show to the airline when checking-in and during the health screening process on arrival in Chile. The health authorities will provide the detail of this process by email following the health screening. <br>
Upon arrival, you should follow the instructions of airport authorities regarding testing requirements. You might need to undergo an antigen or PCR test SARS-COV-2, either in the airport or at an external laboratory outside the airport. If the latter, you will need to do this within 24 hours of arrival. If you undergo an antigen test, you will need to wait for the results in the airport.

  <br> 
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Chile: The Chilean government provides coronavirus-related information on the <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/"">Official COVID-19 Government website</a>. Travellers arriving in Chile should be aware that local authorities frequently move municipalities (comunas) back and forth through the government “Stages Plan” (Paso a Paso) according to the level of COVID-19 restrictions in place. You should review the <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/pasoapaso#situacioncomunal/"">Chilean Government Paso a Paso website</a> to check which stage your ‘comuna’ is in and if there are restrictions that might affect your travel plans. <br>

Travellers (including children aged 12 and above) are required to hold a valid Mobility Pass for inter-regional travel. Children under the age of 12 must travel with an adult who must have a valid mobility pass. <br>

 <br>
 <br>
 International Restrictions:<br>
 *Entry and transit: You will need a valid visa to enter China. The Chinese Visa Application Centres in many countries, are operating but with limited opening hours. <br> 
The Chinese authorities have suspended all direct flights from the UK. This measure will be subject to review but no date has been announced. Restrictions on travel to China from other countries, and the necessary requirements, may be different. Foreign nationals travelling to China from a third country should follow the directions on the website of the local Chinese Embassy or consulate for requirements from that country. <br>
If you’re issued a visa to travel to China in these circumstances you will need to submit a Health Declaration Form to your nearest Chinese Embassy or Consulate in your country before you travel, who will need to certify your form and return it to you via email. <br>
In order to receive a Health Declaration Form from the Chinese Embassy you must provide evidence of a negative nucleic acid test seven days before you travel, followed by a negative nucleic acid and an IgM antibody test for COVID-19 taken no more than 48 hours before you travel. <br>
Reports of both your nucleic acid (COVID-19) and IgM (antibody) tests must come from the same service provider. This does not mean the provider must carry out both tests, but that the provider must guarantee both test reports. You should arrange to take a private test from one of the eligible providers listed on the <a href=""https://www.mfa.gov.cn/ce/ceuk/eng/visa/jiankangmaEn/t1854940.htm""> Embassy website</a>.
A limited number of international flights from other countries are flying into Beijing. Other international passenger flights to Beijing continue to be diverted to 16 designated airports in Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Lanzhou, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou, Xi’an and Wuhan. A small number of international flights are also operating direct between European cities and Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao. <br>
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status: China has not yet confirmed that it will accept the solutions for demonstrating your COVID vaccination status. You should follow guidance for alternative entry requirements. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination. <br>
Health checks on arrival: All international arrivals will be subject to PCR testing on arrival, during and after quarantine. Even asymptomatic carriers will be isolated in a Covid hospital until they return at least three consecutive negative results. There have been some cases of individuals testing intermittently positive for a number of weeks. Travellers with a history of COVID-19 infection should consider leaving a gap between an infection and travel to China. All travellers should take precautions before and during travel to minimise as far as possible the chances of testing positive on arrival. <br>
Health regulations surrounding passengers arriving from overseas are continuously changing. You should contact the Chinese embassies before you travel if you have any questions regarding these entry requirements, quarantine rules or the requirements for individual cities. <br>
Quarantine requirements: Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine for at least 14 days. At some points of entry children 14 and over will be required to quarantine alone irrespective of whether they test positive or negative for COVID. <br>
You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. Whilst we cannot prevent this, if it happens to you or is about to happen, you can call your consular assistance. Non-residents may be charged for their care.<br> 
Quarantine is usually spent at either a centralised government hotel (with costs covered by the traveller) or your home. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice and may differ from province to province. <br>
Follow-up swab tests are likely to take place during your quarantine period. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will need to go into a government quarantine hospital.<br>
For all quarantine arrangements in China: <br>
•        unless directed by the authorities you’re not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you’re also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine <br>
•        depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi <br>
•        during your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room<br>
•        if meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside <br>
•        larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms. <br>
•        if you’re on prescription medication make sure you bring enough with you to last for at least 3-4 weeks together with medical documents certifying that you need to take this medication. <br>
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions or testing put in place, or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals. <br>
After quarantine: Following quarantine, you will need to obtain a green QR health code in order to secure accommodation. In cities with lockdowns, many hotels no longer accept new guests, including those who have recently arrived into China and completed mandatory quarantine. Before arriving into China, you should ensure you have confirmed your accommodtion following your mandatory quarantine <br>
  <br>
  <br> 
Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health kit apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations. Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces need travellers from high to medium risk areas to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level and procedures vary, so check in advance.<br>
The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory lockdowns in response to fresh outbreaks is high. Such lockdowns may result in disruptions to medical and other basic services, including food delivery. You should ensure you have prepared additional food, water and medical supplies in case you are mandated to isolate at home. There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice, including requirements for evidence of a negative COVID-19 NAT test within 48 hours of travel from high to medium risk areas. <br>
There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19.<br>

 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Cuba: Travel and transport within and between Provinces varies according to the COVID-19 measures in place. Any change in the COVID-19 situation in a province or municipality may mean inter-provincial or municipal transport links also change and curfews may be imposed. <br>
Face masks must be worn at all times when travelling on buses, in taxis, and private hire vehicles. <br>
Visitors are allowed to hire cars but should check with the hire companies if they are open, have cars available, and where you can drive to under current COVID-19 measures, before making plans. <br>
Check with your tour operator and seek local advice if you have questions about excursions to other parts of Cuba, including whether car hire is allowed. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels and guest houses are open. Guests may have to wear face masks in some hotel areas and facilities. <br>
Campsites are also open. <br>
Medical teams in hotels will check on health of guests, including taking their temperature, and will be available to guests who feel unwell in between those visits. Local medical representatives will visit campsites and “casas particulares” (private guest house). Anyone with respiratory symptoms may be moved to a clinic or isolation centre and will have to pay for PCR test(s) and medical services by credit card. Any travelling companion may be required to self-isolate in their accommodation pending a negative PCR test result, or be tested themselves. <br>
Hotels may limit the numbers of people using facilities at any one time, especially swimming pools (if open) and elevators. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Wearing a face mask in public is compulsory, as is social distancing of a minimum of 1.5 metres. <br>

 International Restrictions:<br>
*All travellers: You will need a visa with a valid travel document to enter Ethiopia. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Passengers age 12 and over who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 more than two weeks before the date of entry are required to show evidence of this. Accepted vaccinations are a single dose of Johnson and Johnson, or two doses for Astra-Zeneca, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Moderna and Pfizer. <br>
Travellers under the age of 12 do not need to show proof of vaccination.
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test result issued within the 72 hours (3 days) before departure, or a rapid lateral flow test up to 24 hours before arriving in Ethiopia. A lateral flow test must be certified by a testing centre and not self administered. Pre-departure tests are not required for passengers under the age of 12 or diplomats. You may need to demonstrate you have such a test certificate before boarding your flight.
You should arrange to take a private test. 
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past 90 days: If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 you can enter Ethiopia if you have certificate of recovery from within the last 90 days or evidence of vaccination as above.
Children and young people: Children under 12 are not required to be vaccinated or show evidence of recovery.
*If you’re transiting through Ethiopia: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
If you are planning to travel via Ethiopia, you should be aware that restrictions apply. Transit passengers are those with an onward ticket to another destination, who do not formally enter Ethiopia. Transiting passengers are exempt from the current quarantine restrictions for COVID-19. The maximum transit time is 72 hours. <br>
While you don’t need a negative COVID-19 test to transit Addis Ababa, you should ensure that you have the correct tests for your onward journey. Check  the countries you are travelling to. Foreign nationals have previously been tested in transit and had to complete mandatory quarantine in Ethiopia after testing positive for COVID-19.
Passengers transiting for 24 hours or less can remain in the departure lounge of the airport. For transits over 24 hours, you will be taken to a designated transit hotel for the duration of your stay. On arrival in Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, you should report to the transit desk to confirm your hotel details. After health screening and immigration you will then need to present your hotel details and passport to the desk marked “transit shuttle bus” from where you will be taken to the hotel. You will not be able to leave the hotel during your transit. To the extent airline schedules allow, you should therefore minimise the duration of your transit in Addis Ababa. <br>

•        Visits to care homes for the elderly are prohibited. Visits to prisons must comply with coronavirus measures <br>
•        Public transport providers must comply with relevant coronavirus measures, including reduced passenger loads, mask-wearing and ventilation <br>

<br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in France: Wearing masks on public transport is compulsory for everyone aged 6 and over.You could be fined if you don’t comply with this rule. Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling. <br>
There are no internal travel restrictions in France; however, measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should visit the <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus"">French Government Coronavirus Information page</a>
 or use the ‘TousAntiCovid’ digital app for further information and to stay up to date on restrictions. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Face masks are mandatory on public transport and in all health establishments (hospitals, clinics, retirement homes, nursing homes and assisted living, as well as establishments for people with disabilities). <br>
*Pass sanitaire (health pass):<br>
The pass sanitaire is currently required to access the following places:<br>
•        Hospitals, clinics, social/medical health care establishments<br>
•        Retirement homes, nursing homes, independent and assisted-living residences<br>
•        Establishments for people with disabilities<br>
You can find more information on requirements and how to <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/pass-sanitaire"">access the “pass sanitaire” from the French Government</a>.<br>
You can get the pass sanitaire by fulfilling one of the following three criteria:<br>
1.        A vaccination certificate (see details on proof of vaccination below), or<br>
2.        A negative PCR or antigen result from a test taken within the last 24 hours, or<br>
3.        A document (dated more than 11 days ago and less than six months ago) proving you have recently recovered from COVID.<br>
Children under 12 are exempt from ‘pass sanitaire’ requirements.<br>
Proof of vaccination: the French Government recognises vaccination certificates that conform to EU norms. This means: <br>
•        7 days after a third dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Novavax for domestic use (to obtain a valid “health pass”), or<br>
•        28 days after a second dose of Johnson & Johnson, or<br>
•        7 days after a second injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in France) for domestic use (to obtain a valid “vaccine pass”)<br>
Since 15 February 2022, anyone aged over 18 years and 1 month needs to have received a booster dose within 4 months of the initial course (or after infection for those vaccinated in France) to be considered fully vaccinated for domestic purposes (i.e. to use the pass sanitaire). If the pass deactivates because you have not received a booster within 4 months of the initial course, you can reactivate it by receiving a booster dose.<br>
France will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and services: Both the vaccinated and unvaccinated must continue to adhere to basic non-pharmaceutical guidelines, such as social distancing, wearing masks in enclosed spaces, and regularly ventilating indoor spaces. Wearing a medical-grade mask remains a legal requirement in retail outlets and on public transport. Often an FFP-2 mask is required and you should make sure you have an FFP-2 mask with you. More guidance from the <a href=""https://www.zusammengegencorona.de/en/masking-up-ffp2-masks-to-protect-others-and-yourself/"">Federal Health Ministry</a> is available. <br>
German states often require C-19 certification, such asproof of vaccination, recovery from infection or a negative test (up to 24hrs old for rapid antigen testing or 48 hrs old for PCR testing) will be required for entry into: <br>
•        Hospitals and social care settings<br>
•        Indoor gastronomy<br>
•        Participating in events and celebrations<br>
•        Barbers, hairdressers, or beauty salons<br>
•        Indoor sport such as fitness studios, swimming baths or sports halls<br>
•        Hotels (test at arrival and twice a week during the stay)<br>
Children five years old and above are exempt from domestic testing requirements during term time. As school pupils are regularly tested at school, they only need to show their school pupil card to prove their C-19 status. The fully vaccinated can demonstrate their status using Germany’s two C-19 certification apps (the CovPass-App or the Corona-Warn-App; see below)or the UK COVID Pass. Other vaccination certification is accepted for domestic purposes in electronic form as long as it has:<br>
•        The date of vaccination;<br>
•        Name and batch name of the vaccine;<br>
•        Name of the disease against which vaccination was given;<br>
•        Name of the person vaccinated, their date of birth and the name and address of the person responsible for administering the vaccination, and;<br>
•        Confirmation in writing or in electronic form with a qualified electronic signature or a qualified electronic seal by the person responsible for administering the vaccination.<br>
Germany will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Those who have recently recovered from Covid must show a positive PCR test at least 28 days old but no older than six months. As rules may vary please check the latest <a href=""https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/corona-bundeslaender-1745198"">local guidance</a> (in German). There are a variety of sources in English including <a href=""https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/buerokratieabbau/nina-lokale-corona-hinweise-1827552"">Germany’s NINA Warn App</a>
<br>
*Testing positive for COVID-19 in Germany: Anyone testing positive with a Point of Care (PoC) antigen test is required to take a follow-up PCR test immediately and to self-isolate. Close contacts are also required to self-isolate, although exceptions may apply for those who are fully vaccinated. <br>
In the event of a positive PoC test, the test provider is required to notify the local health office (Gesundheitsamt), which is responsible for monitoring self-isolation and will provide further guidance in individual cases. You can find your local health office by postcode <a href=""https://tools.rki.de/plztool/"">here</a>. <br>
Individuals testing positive must self-isolate in their home or where they are staying locally, or in another appropriate location enabling self-isolation. They may only leave their home and interrupt self-isolation to carry out the PCR test. Germany does not operate a system of managed quarantine in government facilities. <br>
Mandatory self-isolation ceases in the event of a negative PCR test. Otherwise self-isolation lasts for 14 days, or until the local health office confirms release.

The travel certificate you generate will be checked prior to departure and on arrival. <br>
If you’re fully vaccinated: All travellers aged 18 years and over are required to provide evidence of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 at the point of embarkation and upon arrival into Ghana. The Ghana Health Service defines a fully vaccinated person as someone who has taken the full dose of vaccines approved and registered by the Food and Drugs Authority of Ghana. This is one dose of Johnson and Johnson, or two doses of AstraZeneca (Covishield), Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or Sputnik V. <br>
You will need to present your vaccination certificate before boarding and on arrival. Expect this certificate to be checked multiple times before leaving the airport, including on leaving the plane, at the health counter, at immigration, and on leaving the airport. You may choose to carry a hard copy of your certificate with you if you are unsure you will have access to the electronic version during your journey. <br>
There is no pre travel or on arrival testing requirement if you are fully vaccinated. <br>
If you’re not fully vaccinated: Non-resident: Non-resident unvaccinated travellers will not be granted entry into Ghana. Ground staff at your departure airport will not allow you to travel. <br>
Resident: You will need to take the following steps in addition to completion of the online health declaration form, set out in more detail below: take a pre travel PCR test; load that onto the Trusted Travel Scheme website and generate a Travel Code; pay for an on arrival test; and be subject to vaccination on arrival.

You will be required to present a negative PCR test that was taken not more than 48 hours before the start of your journey, both to the airline before embarkation, and upon arrival. <br>
The test on arrival is an antigen fluorescent immunoassay test. It is conducted before baggage is collected at a cost of $150 per passenger. (ECOWAS citizens pay $50). Payment should be made online, before travel, as part of the pre travel <a href=""https://www.ghs-hdf.org/"">health declaration form</a> process. Airport staff expect to see the proof of payment as well as your <a href=""https://www.ghs-hdf.org/"">travel certificate</a>  before allowing you to check-in. Test results are normally ready within one hour. You can check your results <a href=""https://www.ghs-hdf.org/result.php""> online</a> while you wait. <br>

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*What to do if you test positive while in Greece: If you test positive for COVID-19 while in Greece you must self-isolate for 5 days from the date of the positive test result. You may leave self-isolation after 5 days if you are no longer experiencing symptoms, otherwise you should continue to self-isolate. <br>
If you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive and have received your booster, you are not obliged to self-isolate but must take a PCR or rapid test on day 5 of the exposure. If you are unvaccinated or are vaccinated but have not received your booster, you must take a PCR or rapid test and self-isolate for 5 days. <br>
The above guidance may not apply in the case of variants of special interest. These cases will be assessed by the EMEA (Greek health authority) and appropriate instructions will be given. <br>
Depending on the circumstances, you may be able to self-isolate in your current accommodation, or Greek authorities will ask you to self-isolate in a state provided quarantine hotel. The expense of the accommodation in quarantine hotels is covered by the Greek state. Local authorities will be able to offer further advice on self-isolation requirements. <br>
If you do not self-isolate or quarantine when required you may be fined by the Hellenic Police. The fine could be as much as €5000. You should comply with any requirement to self-isolate or quarantine. <br>
Plan ahead and make sure you:<br>
•        can access money<br>
•        understand what your insurance will cover<br>
•        can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned<br>
*Quarantine hotels: If you test positive for COVID-19 you may have to enter a quarantine hotel. In Greece, the Greek authorities will pay the cost of your quarantine.<br>
EHIC or GHIC cards can not be used to cover any additional expenses you incur whilst staying in a quarantine hotel. Make sure you have access to funds to cover the costs or take out insurance, checking the policy has adequate cover.<br>
*Wearing a mask: It is mandatory to wear a mask in all indoor public spaces, in all areas of Greece. In certain areas, such as in supermarkets and pharmacies, and on public transport, you will be required to wear either double masks (at least one of which should be surgical), or an N95/FFP2 mask. <br>
*Public spaces and services: All restrictions remain under regular review. In Regional Units (περιφερειακές ενότητες) where the spread of COVID-19 is particularly high and hospital capacity is limited, restrictions may be tighter or re-imposed with limited notice. Check the latest local guidance and follow the advice of local authorities. <br>
Only the most relevant measures to travellers are included below. You should keep up-to-date by checking this page regularly, and following local announcements. <br>
As restrictions may vary, you should <a href=""https://covid19.gov.gr/covid-map-en/"">check the latest local guidance</a>. <br>
•        Until 1 May, proof of vaccination is required to enter public spaces such as shops, restaurants (indoor and outdoor) and museums. You should be prepared to demonstrate your proof of vaccination and present ID (passport or Greek Residence card) when asked. If you are not fully vaccinated (including children), see Unvaccinated in Greece. From 1 May, this requirement will be lifted.<br>
•        You must use a facemask in all indoor public and communal spaces. In certain areas, such as in supermarkets and pharmacies, and on public transport, you will be required to wear either double masks (at least one of which should be surgical), or an N95/FFP2 mask.<br>
•        Unless all passengers are members of the same family, a maximum of 3 persons are permitted to travel in a taxi or other private vehicle with up to 7 seats, or 4 persons in a private vehicle with up to 9 seats.<br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Greece will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. It will also accept proof of COVID-19 vaccination. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to you presenting your evidence of vaccination (this does not apply to boosters, which are valid straight away). Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. COVID-19 recovery certificates are valid for 180 days from the 14th day after the date of the first positive test result.<br>
If you are 18 years old or over and more than 9 months have elapsed since you completed your initial vaccination course against COVID-19, Greece considers your vaccination status expired unless you have received a booster vaccine.<br>
*Travel in Greece: Travel within Greece between Regional Units is permitted subject to adherence to public health measures as outlined above. You must wear either double masks (at least one of which should be surgical) or an N95/FFP2 mask at all times on all public transport.<br>
If you are travelling by internal (domestic) flights, specific measures relating to check-in, baggage allowances and other details may be in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus. You should check with your operator directly for further detail.<br>
*Accommodation: All hotels are permitted to open, and other types of accommodation, including e.g. Airbnb, private rentals and hostels, are also available. However, you should note that many operators are likely to reduce their offer and close some accommodation during the winter months, particularly in light of measures put in place by the Greek authorities to fight the spread of COVID-19. You should check directly with your accommodation provider in case of related concerns.<br>

  <br>
  <br>
International Restrictions:<br>
*All travellers: You don’t need a visa to enter Israel. On entry, visitors are granted leave to enter for a period of up to 3 months. <br>
Visitors entering via Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport are given an entry card instead of an entry stamp in their passport. While this practice is in place at other ports of entry, there have been instances where passports have been stamped for entry purposes. You should keep your entry card with your passport until you leave. This is evidence of your legal entry into Israel and may be required, particularly at any crossing points into the Occupied Palestinian Territories. If you’re refused entry into Israel, your passport may be stamped with an entry stamp and two red lines drawn across it to indicate the refusal. <br>
It is for the Israeli authorities to determine the right of entry into Israel, if you have any particular concerns about visas or entry into Israel. If you work in Israel without the proper authority, you can be detained and then deported, a process which could take several months. Consular staff will not be able to help you enter Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories. They are unable get involved in another country’s immigration policy or procedures. <br>
At the Allenby Bridge crossing with Jordan, as well as at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport, Israeli border officials have on occasions used an entry stamp for certain travellers that states ‘Palestinian Authority only’ or ‘Judea and Samaria only’. Since travellers entering via the Allenby Bridge crossing must pass through Israeli checkpoints and Israeli-controlled territory to reach Jerusalem or Gaza, this restriction effectively limits travellers who receive this stamp. It is not clear how a traveller receiving the stamp at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport can leave the airport without violating the restriction. This stamp has been issued to travellers who have no Palestinian or other Arab ancestry, and who would not seem to have any claim to a Palestinian Authority ID. <br>
Israeli border officials at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport have also at times required certain travellers to sign a form that states that he/she is not allowed to enter territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority unless he/she obtains advance authorisation from the Israeli ‘Territory Actions Co-ordinator’, and that violating this restriction may result in the traveller being deported from Israel and barred from entry for up to 10 years. In March 2017 the Israeli Parliament passed a law which gives authority to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott. <br>
Emergency Travel Documents: Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories unless the holder is a returning resident. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Israel. <br>
Previous Travel to Other Countries: Evidence of a previous visit to another country in the region like an entry/exit stamp in your passport does not normally prevent entry into Israel, although it may lead to additional questioning at the border. It is for the Israeli authorities to determine the right of entry into Israel, so if you have any particular concerns about previous travel to another country, you should contact the Israeli embassies . <br>
Customs and Immigration: You should expect lengthy personal questioning and baggage searches by security officials on arrival and departure from Israel. Electrical items, including laptops, may be taken from departing passengers for security inspection and either stored in the aircraft baggage hold, or returned to you in the UK. Damage may occur. <br>
If you arrive with valuable personal items (computers, camcorders etc.) you may be required to pay a deposit that is refundable on or after departure. <br>
Israeli security officials have on occasion requested access to travellers’ personal e-mail accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of entry. <br>
Entry to the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs), including by sea to Gaza, is controlled by the Israeli authorities. You must produce a passport and immigration slip, to cross between Israel and the OPTs. <br>
You may be detained on arrival and deported if you are intending to enter Gaza without permission. If you’re entering the country for the purpose of working in the OPTs, you may be refused entry. <br>
For more information, contact the nearest Israeli Embassy.
Dual nationals: dual nationals living in the West Bank and Gaza are allowed to travel abroad only via the Rafah or Allenby Bridge border crossings into Egypt or Jordan and return via the same route. <br>
Children with Israeli parents (father and/or mother) are considered to be Israeli nationals. The Israeli Ministry of Interior insists that these children enter and leave Israel on an Israeli passport.<br>
If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Israel/The Occupied Palestinian Territories. <br>
Non-Israeli citizens will need to present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours before the flight to Israel. These tests must be performed by a professional test lab in the origin country and should state the full name and passport number of the passenger. Self, home tests will not be accepted. <br>
All travellers must have a health insurance policy with coverage for the treatment of COVID-19. The insurance policy is mandatory to enter Israel. You are required to fill out an <a href=""https://corona.health.gov.il/en/flights/"">entry statement form  </a> within 48 hours before your flight to Israel. <br>
On arrival in Israel, you must take a further PCR test before leaving the airport, at your own expense. You can make the payment after you submit the entry statement form prior to traveling to Israel. Payment in advance is at a reduced price. Only PCR tests are admissible. <br>
All passengers must enter home isolation until the results of their PCR test arrive, or 24 hours have passed. If the result of the test is positive the individual will be required to remain in home isolation for a minimum of 14 days, although this can be reduced by taking a second PCR test on day 7. Entrants from ‘red’ locations may be required to isolate in a government facility. <br>
Full guidance on requirements upon arrival is regularly updated online. Check <a href=""https://www.gov.il/en/departments/population_and_immigration_authority"">Israeli Population and Immigration Authority</a> pages and the dedicated <a href=""https://corona.health.gov.il/en/directives/air-travel-covid19-israel/"">COVID-19 Air Transport website</a>  for full details. Further restrictions may be introduced at short notice. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Israel/The Occupied Palestinian Territories to receive a Green Pass. The Green Pass will exempt individuals from isolation if they come into contact with a COVID patient during their stay in Israel. <br>
You can use the proof of COVID-19 vaccination record to demonstrate your vaccination status when entering Israel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>
If you hold a verifiable digital certificate proving vaccination status, this should be scanned or uploaded along with the entry declaration. If you do not have a verifiable digital certificate, you should declare the vaccinations you have received in the entry declaration form and attach all relevant documentation. You will then receive a Green Pass prior to boarding your flight. <br>
Entry via Land Borders: Restrictions also apply at land crossings between Israel and Jordan, and between the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Jordan. You can find the latest guidance on entering and exiting Israel via the land borders on the <a href=""https://corona.health.gov.il/en/directives/leaving-israel/#sea-and-land"">Israeli Ministry of Health’s website</a>
Those wishing to enter Jordan from Israel will need to register in advance. You can find more information on the <a href=""https://www.visitjordan.gov.jo/""> Visit Jordan website</a>.
You may face delays or restrictions at Israeli controlled checkpoints around the West Bank, including when attempting to leave the West Bank. <br>
If you’re not fully vaccinated: If you are not fully vaccinated, you can enter Israel/The Occupied Palestinian Territories. You will not be eligible for a Green Pass without proof you are vaccinated or recovered. <br>
Non-Israeli citizens will need to present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours before the flight to Israel. These tests must be performed by a professional test lab in the origin country and should state the full name and passport number of the passenger. Self, home tests will not be accepted. <br>

Depending on your vaccination status, where you are travelling from, and whether you are identified as a close contact of a positive case , you may be subject to up to 7 full days of quarantine and/or self-isolation following your arrival. Further details can be found in the section on vaccination status below, and on the <a href=""https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/03112200QA_EN.pdf"">Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare </a>  and  <a href=""https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a>.

Processing times are currently longer than standard. Anyone arriving in the country without a valid visa will not be able to enter. <br>
It is illegal to work in Japan without the correct visa, however informal or temporary the work. You shouldn’t overstay your permission to remain in the country, as you risk arrest, detention and a heavy fine. <br>
If you’re fully vaccinated: If you can prove you have received two doses of AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna vaccines (or one of Johnson & Johnson) and an additional booster shot from Pfizer or Moderna , then you will be considered fully vaccinated and are exempt from quarantine and self-isolation. Note that AstraZenaca is not accepted as a valid booster. Note also that if you are identified as a close contact of someone who tests positive on arrival, you will be required to quarantine or self-isolate for 7 days. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: You can use the COVID Pass to demonstrate your vaccination record to the Japanese authorities. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccination status. <br>

Alternatively, if you do not wish to take a Day 3 COVID-19 test, you may opt to spend 7 full days in self-isolation. <br>
You must have received two doses of the vaccine (or one of Johnson & Johnson) plus a booster shot of an approved vaccine in order to be considered fully vaccinated. 
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: Proof of prior infection does not afford exemptions. You must follow the rules and regulations outlined above. <br>
Children and young people: Minors are not exempt from the testing requirements on age grounds. There may be some flexibility on pre-flight testing requirements for children aged 5 and under, but this cannot be guaranteed. All travellers must take the test on arrival in Japan. <br>
For children under 18, provided they are accompanied by a fully-vaccinated parent (who has received their booster shot) who supervises their activities, they may follow the same rules as their parent even if the child is not fully-vaccinated. <br>

The COVID-19 regulations and requirements outlined above do not apply to passengers who are transiting through one Japanese airport and do not go through immigration. However, transit may be precluded by airport closures, movement between terminals and delays between arriving and departing flights. Check with your airline whether your connection is feasible before boarding a flight to Japan. <br>

International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: You will need to wear two face masks or a KN95 mask on flights bound for Peru and must complete an <a href=""https://djsaludviajero.minsa.gob.pe/dj-salud/"">affidavit</a>  to enter or travel through Peru as a visitor. <br>
Normally, you don’t need a visa to travel if the purpose of the visit is tourism. If you’re travelling for any other purpose, check entry clearance requirements with the Peruvian Consulate-General. <br>
Immigration: If you enter Peru overland from Ecuador, make sure your passport is stamped with a Peruvian entry stamp at the local immigration office. Most people crossing the border with Ecuador enter Peru through Aguas Verdes (Tumbes region) - you may need to ask for directions to the immigration office. If your passport is not stamped at the border with Ecuador, you can have it stamped at the Immigration Office in the city of Tumbes. <br>
If you enter Peru from Bolivia by bus or taxi, make sure your passport is stamped with a Peruvian entry stamp at the immigration office in Desaguadero or Copacabana (Puno region). Immigration authorities may also not let you leave Peru without a valid exit stamp from the last country you visited. <br>
If you enter Peru without an entry stamp then you’re required by law to apply for a new entry stamp at the nearest immigration office. The immigration authorities will need you to provide your passport and evidence of your entry to Peru, eg air/bus ticket in your name, exit stamp from the last country you visited, and any other documentation they deem necessary. If you’re unable to provide any such evidence you must apply for an exit or expulsion order at the Immigration Office in Lima. You won’t be allowed to leave Peru without this, and you may be prevented from re-entering Peru for the next five to ten years. <br>
The Embassy can’t intervene in immigration issues. Make sure you get your entry stamp when you arrive in Peru, but if your passport was not stamped on entry into Peru, we can assist you in requesting the entry stamp or the exit order. The sooner you start that process, the better. <br>
Please note that passports are not stamped when you enter Peru through Jorge Chavez inter-national airport in Lima. Your details will be recorded in the immigration database and will be available when you leave Peru. <br>
If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Peru without needing to test or quarantine. <br>
Passengers aged 12 and over whose final destination is Peru must show evidence of full vaccination received either in Peru or abroad. Those under 12 years old must be without COVID-19 symptoms but do not require a test or proof of vaccination. Adults who reside in Peru must have received the booster (third) dose. These rules are subject to change at short notice.  Anyone who shows COVID-19 symptoms on arrival in Peru must isolate by law. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Peru. <br>
Peru will accept the proof of COVID-19 vaccination and that issued in the Crown Dependencies. Although digital proof is accepted, you should also take a hard copy. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>
If you’re not fully vaccinated: Unvaccinated arrivals aged 12 and above, need to show proof of a negative PCR test (taken no more than 48 hours before entry) when entering Peru. <br>
Children and young people: Children aged under 12 do not need to show proof of vaccination to enter Peru. Any child who shows COVID-19 symptoms on arrival in Peru must isolate by law.<br>
If you’re transiting through Peru: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. If you are transiting through Peru on your way to another country and staying in the airport (airside) you do not need to meet the vaccination and PCR requirements to enter Peru as above. <br>
If you are transiting through Peru on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for whichever reason, you need to meet the full requirements to enter Peru as above. <br>
Exemptions: There are no exemptions for Peru’s entry requirements.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Peru: A state of emergency continues to be in force in Peru due to COVID-19. The Peruvian government operates a four-tier system of restrictions (Extreme, Very High, High and Moderate). There is a requirement to wear two masks (one cloth, one surgical) or a KN95 mask in shops and other indoor public spaces. The use of masks outdoors is optional in some regions, according to its vaccination rates, but still required in others. Please follow local authorities’ instructions.<br>
Adults must show evidence of having received a booster dose to enter most indoor venues, if they reside in Peru. This can be provided on paper or digitally, and foreign vaccination certificates are accepted. Masks must also be worn as specified above. Children aged 5 and over will be allowed to enter sports stadiums and other venues if they show evidence of having been fully vaccinated either in Peru or abroad. All domestic air passengers aged 12 and over will be allowed to board only if they show evidence of having been fully vaccinated either in Peru or abroad. Adults must show evidence of having received a booster dose if they reside in Peru. Alternatively, they can show proof of a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR (molecular) test, issued a maximum of 48 hours before the flight departs. Under 12s old must be without COVID-19 symptoms but do not require a test or proof of vaccination.

International Restrictions: <br>
*Testing on arrival: All foreign nationals arriving in South Korea are required to provide a negative PCR test certificate. The test must have been taken within the 48 hours prior to departure. If you have recently recovered from COVID-19 in Korea, you may upload a certificate of recovery rather than a negative PCR test result into the Q-Code system prior to departure. For all other foreign travellers, it is required to receive a negative PCR test result as described above before you are able to fly to South Korea. <br>
All arrivals, including children aged 5 and younger, and regardless of nationality and length of stay, are also required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) within 24 hours after entering South Korea. You can reserve an appointment for a PCR test upon arrival at Incheon Airport through the <a href=""https://www.airport.kr/ap_cnt/en/svc/covid19/medical/medical.do"">Airport Clinic’s website</a> or take a PCR test within 24 hours of arrival in South Korea at a medical institution near your accommodation or residence. Foreign short-term travellers must pay for a PCR test at either the Airport Clinic or a medical institution while Korean citizens and long-term visa-holders may visit a local public health centre to take a PCR test for free within 24 hours of arrival. <br>
If you have registered your overseas vaccination history through the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system/< a> before traveling to Korea, you may proceed to your final destination by public transport and take a PCR test within 24 hours. If your test is positive, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. You will be required to stay at a quarantine centre for 7 days (if you are a short-term visitor) or to isolate at home (if you are a long-term resident and if your accommodation meets certain standards). You will not need to take another PCR test at the end of your quarantine. For more information contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 from inside South Korea (support is available in English). <br>
Quarantine requirements: Vaccinated travellers who have completed their COVID-19 vaccination in Korea or have completed vaccination overseas and have registered their vaccination history through the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> before traveling to Korea will be eligible for quarantine exemption. <br>
Vaccination is considered to be complete 14 days after the 2nd shot for a two-dose vaccine (valid up to 180 days). In addition, vaccination is considered complete and remains valid indefinitely following booster shots. <br>
For those who have not completed vaccination or who have not registered their vaccination history through the Q-Code system, the default requirement when entering South Korea is to quarantine for seven days at home (if you are resident in South Korea) or in a government quarantine facility (if you are visiting). You can avoid quarantine entirely if you register your vaccination status through the 
<a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a>  or if you have a ‘quarantine exemption’ certificate issued by a Korean embassy.<br>
If you’re visiting and must quarantine, you can quarantine with relatives if you can prove your relationship to them and if their accommodation meets certain standards. If you must quarantine and are a Korean national or long-term foreign resident with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence, you may self-quarantine at home. <br>
Foreign short-term travellers who are not eligible for quarantine exemption may be able to quarantine with family members under specific circumstances. Your family member must be your spouse or a “lineal” family member (parents/grandparents or children/grandchildren, not a sibling) of you or your spouse and must be resident in Korea (i.e. a Korean national or a foreigner with a long-term stay visa). You must be able to prove your family relationship, for example by showing your ID, a copy of your family member’s Korean ID, and a marriage or birth certificate, which must be legalised (or “apostilled”). Certified translations are required for documents not in English. Your family’s accommodation must meet certain basic standards (typically, they must have a separate bedroom and a separate bathroom for you). Your family must also be available to pick you up from the airport or the quarantine facility. These rules may change at short notice – your family member in Korea should double-check the rules before you travel by calling the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 (support is available in English). <br>
Foreign short-term travellers who are unvaccinated or who have not registered their vaccination history through the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> must quarantine at a government-designated facility for seven days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 120,000KRW while in government quarantine facilities. <br>
Onward travel from the airport: If you are an unvaccinated, short-term visitor quarantining with family members, your family members must pick you up from the airport or from a quarantine facility later. <br>
Quarantine transport options are available from the airport for unvaccinated travellers. Guidance is available at the airport on how best to proceed to your destination. <br>
Vaccinated travellers may proceed to their final destination by public transport. <br>
Data collection: Individuals will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile app. <br>
Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea. <br>

Quarantine exemption availability: Vaccinated travellers who have completed their COVID-19 vaccination in Korea or have completed vaccination overseas and have registered their vaccination history through the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> before traveling to Korea will be eligible for quarantine exemption.<br>
Vaccination is considered to be complete 14 days after the 2nd shot for a two-dose vaccine (valid up to 180 days) or with booster shots. <br>
Entrants from certain countries may be excluded from exemption, even if fully vaccinated. Check the <a href=""http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/tcmBoardList.do?brdId=12&brdGubun=125&dataGubun=&ncvContSeq=&contSeq=&board_id="">Ministry of Health and Welfare’s website</a>  for further details. <br>
Unvaccinated individuals may be able to apply for Quarantine Exemptions from Korean embassies in some circumstances. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: You do not need to demonstrate proof of overseas vaccination in order to enter South Korea, however, if you do not register completed overseas vaccinations through the Q-Code system, you will be expected to quarantine for seven days. If you were vaccinated in South Korea, your vaccination status will be automatically linked to the Q-Code system from the COOV database. All arrivals are required to be tested. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: There are no special provisions for unvaccinated individuals. <br>
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If you have recently recovered from COVID-19, you will still need to receive a negative PCR test result. You should bring with you an official note from your doctor detailing when you tested positive, what treatment you received and/or what isolation you observed. If you test positive or inconclusive on arrival, Korean officials will consider this information when deciding how to proceed. Some Foreign Nationals have tested negative in their country and then tested positive on arrival in South Korea. Korean health officials have broad discretion in deciding what precautions are required and you may be required to quarantine even if you are no longer testing positive. <br>
Otherwise, there are no special provisions for individuals who have had COVID-19 in the past year. <br>

*Testing positive for COVID-19: If you think you might have COVID-19 while in South Korea, you should self-isolate immediately and contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 for guidance (support is available in English). Outdoor sites where you can receive a free test are common in most cities. If you are eligible to receive a PCR test, you will usually receive your results via text message within 1-2 days. If you are not eligible to receive a PCR test, you will receive an antigen test which provides results within approximately 30 minutes. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. The Korean authorities have made clear that if you have no or mild symptoms you will generally be eligible for quarantine and treatment at home, unless you are unable to sufficiently isolate from others. If the Korean authorities judge it necessary, you will be moved to a quarantine centre or a hospital/treatment centre. There is currently no charge for quarantine centre stays or for medical care in a hospital/treatment centre as long as you have not violated any quarantine measures. Fully vaccinated individuals will generally need to quarantine (whether at home or in a facility) for seven days. Korean health authorities generally have broad discretion to apply the rules as they see fit. You may face additional costs from your travel provider if you have to rearrange your travel. <br>
Anyone displaying symptoms or returning a positive test result for COVID-19 must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment, deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for the cost of your treatment and for any economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors.

People aged 12 or over must wear face masks in enclosed areas of public vehicles, as well as in publicly accessible indoor areas of hospitals and clinics, retirement and care homes. Failure to wear a mask is punishable by a fine. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from this requirement, as are individuals who are unable to wear a mask for medical reasons. <br>
Anyone who tests positive for the coronavirus during their stay in Switzerland must self-isolate for 5 days. Details can be found on the Isolation and contact page of the Federal Office of Public Health.

Switzerland will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination. You will also need to show photographic ID (e.g. passport, driving licence). If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November 2021 to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Vaccinated visitors who don’t have an EU Digital COVID Certificate (EUDCC) or a certificate that is compatible with the EUDCC (e.g. the NHS COVID Pass) can apply online for a Swiss COVID certificate. This costs CHF 30. Applications take 5 working days to be processed. Further information is available on the <a href=""https://covidcertificate-form.admin.ch/foreign"">application website</a>. <br>

*All travellers. Travel ban on foreign nationals. Taiwan has in place a temporary ban on foreign nationals entering Taiwan. However there are certain exceptions, as follows. <br>
The <a href=""https://en.mofa.gov.tw/"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)</a> has announced that, from 13 April 2022, foreign relatives of Taiwan citizens and foreign residents in Taiwan, with the exception of migrant workers, are now able to apply for a special entry permit to enter Taiwan. Applicants will be required to complete an <a href=""https://visawebapp.boca.gov.tw/BOCA_EVISA/"">online visa application form</a> and to submit the required documentation to the Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA) for consideration. <br>
In addition, exceptions apply for the following groups: ARC/APRC/Gold Card holders, business travellers, foreign spouses of Taiwan passport holders and their children under the age of 20, foreign relatives of Taiwan passport holders, international students and foreign professors and researchers. <br>
All foreign nationals will be required to have obtained the correct entry permissions and a visa before they arrive in Taiwan. Currently there is no set date for when these border measures will be lifted. Exceptions may be made for emergency or humanitarian reasons. You should contact your local Taipei Representative Office for further information. Anyone entering Taiwan will be required to follow the quarantine requirements set out below. All passengers travelling to Taiwan will be required to follow the quarantine and testing requirements set out below. <br>
*Screening on arrival: All passengers arriving or transiting in Taiwan are required to present a certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken within two calendar days of boarding their flight to Taiwan. The test will be calculated based on the “specimen collection date” not the test report date. Any exemption due to exceptional circumstances will require prior approval before departure. <br>
Test Certificates of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR must be issued by a recognised medical institution in the country of departure and include the following information: <br>
•        the passenger’s full name as per their passport,<br>
•        the date of birth or passport number of the traveller,<br>
•        specimen collection date and test report date,<br>
•        the virus name, testing method and the test result<br>
Test Certificates are required to be produced in either English or Chinese; however, in situations where the passenger provides a certificate in either French or Spanish, if the certificate is in the official language of the place of departure, and ground personnel of the airline are able to assist with the inspection of the content, the certificate may be accepted.<br>
All passengers arriving in Taiwan on a long-haul flight will be required to undergo a COVID-19 RT-PCR test upon arrival. Passengers will be required to wait for the result of this test at the airport before they are permitted to depart for their quarantine facility. The local authorities will cover the cost of the COVID-19 RT-PCR test. Any individual who receives a positive COVID-19 test will not be permitted to quarantine at a quarantine hotel in Taiwan. Individuals with mild symptoms will be admitted into a centralised quarantine centre for the mandatory fourteen days (see above). Any individual with more severe symptoms may be hospitalised.<br>
Anyone found to provide false or incorrect test results, or evade or obstruct the quarantine measures, may face a fine of between NT$10,000 to NT$150,000 and further criminal charges.<br>
Refer to the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En"">Taiwan Centers for Disease Control</a> for further information regarding Test Exemptions, Test Certificates and COVID-19 test requirements. You should arrange to take a private test.<br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Taiwan providing that you have obtained the correct entry permissions and a visa. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: If you’re not fully vaccinated, you will also be able to enter Taiwan providing that you have obtained the correct entry permissions and a visa. There are currently no additional quarantine or testing requirements for passengers who are not fully vaccinated. <br>
*Children and young people: Children under the age of 12 would be subject to the same quarantine requirements as their parents or legal guardians. You may be separated from your children if they test positive for COVID-19. If this happens and you need support, you can contact the British Office Taipei on +886 (2) 8758 2088. For further information on healthcare in Taiwan, please see the Coronavirus section. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Taiwan: Transiting is when you pass through one country or territory on the way to your final destination. Due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, foreign nationals are not currently permitted to transit in Taiwan. Rules and procedures may change at short notice. For further information, you should contact your airline. <br>
*Exemptions: Compassionate reasons. Exemptions to the rules may apply for:<br>
•        Close family members of seriously or terminally ill patients<br>

<br>
<br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Pre-Departure COVID-19 PCR Testing: Any individual who receives a positive COVID-19 PCR test will not be permitted to board an aircraft to depart Taiwan. Instead, you will be required by law to complete a mandatory quarantine: the length of which will depend on the seriousness of the case. Individuals with mild symptoms will be admitted into a centralised quarantine centre for this period. It may also be possible to quarantine at your residential property providing this meets the quarantine requirements. Any individual with more severe symptoms may be hospitalised. This applies to all nationalities and age groups and is irrespective of the purpose of their intended travel. The decision regarding these arrangements will be made by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and on a case by case basis.
Any individual who receives a positive COVID-19 PCR test will be contacted by their local health bureau who will advise on their mandatory quarantine arrangements. Visit the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En"">Taiwan Centers for Disease Control website</a> or contact their helpline on 1922 for further information. <br>
Further information regarding quarantine requirements at your residential property can be found in the Healthcare in Taiwan section. For passengers travelling with children, you should check with your airline before you travel regarding the COVID-19 test requirements. Any individuals who breach Taiwan’s epidemic prevention measures may face a fine of up to NTD $1,000,000. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) has announced that starting from 1 March 2022, epidemic prevention measures across Taiwan will now be reviewed on a monthly basis. In line with the CECC’s general guidelines, the Taiwanese authorities have advised that further localised epidemic prevention measures may be introduced in certain cities or counties depending on the COVID-19 situation in each location. <br>
For the month of April, the following measures are now in place:<br>

You will need a letter of invitation (LOI), certified by the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan, from a private individual or company to support your application. For tourists, these can be obtained from authorised travel agents. A list is available from the  Embassy in Ashgabat. Those travelling on business for the first time must obtain letters from relevant ministries, departments or companies they wish to co-operate with, unless the visit is made to attend an exhibition or other event, in which case the organiser normally provides visa support. <br>
Without prior approval from the Turkmen authorities, it is not possible to enter Turkmenistan. It is possible to buy a visa on arrival at either Ashgabat and Turkmenabad airports or the ferry port at Turkmenbashi but only if you have approval from the Turkmenistan Migration Service before arrival. If you break your journey or try to enter Turkmenistan without the right visa you will face a long and uncomfortable wait in the offices of the Immigration Service at the airport or ferry port. <br>
In addition to a visa fee, there are charges of up to US$150 for vehicles entering Turkmenistan by either land or sea. These can include elements for disinfection, an entry permit, insurance and a compensatory amount for fuel subsidies operating in Turkmenistan. The rate is changeable and varies depending on the entry point, the type of vehicle, its engine capacity and distance you intend to travel. All are payable in cash in US Dollars on entry. <br>
If you are staying for more than 3 days you should register with the State Service of Turkmenistan for the Registration of Foreign Nationals. Don’t overstay your visa. <br>
All foreign nationals need a visa to transit Turkmenistan. You can be registered at entry and exit points if your stay is not longer than five days and you hold a valid transit visa. But you won’t be able to change your transit visa in-country, and you must notify the authorities if you intend to vary your route through the country. <br>
If you intend to travel from Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan across the Caspian Sea you should be aware that it is not possible to buy a visa on arrival at Baku seaport. Make sure you have a valid visa to enter Azerbaijan if you take the ferry. On arrival, you must pay a US$14 migration fee ($10 fee plus $4 Admin charge). <br>
You must register within three days of arrival with the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan at their office at 57 Azadi Street, Ashgabat. Registration is for the period of the visa and may be carried out on your behalf. If you are not staying in Ashgabat, you should register at the local department of Migration Service instead. You should bring two passport size photos. The State Migration Service of Turkmenistan will need a letter confirming your departure from Turkmenistan. A de-registration stamp in your passport is no longer required. Non-compliance with these requirements could lead to prosecution and possible detention. <br>
Single parents or other adults travelling alone with children should contact the Turkmen Embassy for advice about the documents that will be required at immigration.
If you intend to enter Turkmenistan with medicines, whether prescription or non-prescription, you should check in advance the list of prohibited medicines and the legal quantities of medicines that are allowed into the country. <br>
Substances of concern to the Turkmen authorities include but are not limited to tramadol, morphine, opiates or any other constituent competent that may be considered as a narcotic drug or psychotropic agent. Possession of these items can lead to administrative or criminal proceedings if you don’t have a prescription, or if you’re carrying more than you need for your visit and don’t declare them on arrival. <br>
If you’re travelling with prescription medicines, you should carry a doctor’s prescription and declare the items on your customs declaration form. Some medicines that are non-prescription in your country, including codeine, can cause problems on entry into Turkmenistan. Issues have been reported at both the international airport and land borders.<br>
To enter or transit Turkmenistan you will need an exit visa from the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan or Department of Visa and Registration before you can travel out of Turkmenistan. This process can take up to 5 working days. Turkmen border crossings can be subject to occasional and unannounced closures. <br>

*Entry requirements: Upon arrival, all non-exempt foreign nationals are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. <br>
All non-exempt foreign nationals, in addition to their health insurance policy, must have: <br>
•        a document confirming receipt of at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination with WHO-approved vaccines – which Ukraine lists as Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria, Covishield and SKBio), Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and CoronaVac, or one of: <br>
•        a negative Rapid Antigen Test taken no more than 72 hours before entry, or; <br>
•        a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before entry. <br>
The requirement for proof of vaccination or a negative test does not apply to children under 12. <br>
Non-exempt foreign nationals without proof of vaccination (ie one or both doses) will be required on arrival to install the “Vdoma” app, which monitors self-isolation. The State Border Service will refuse entry to anyone who is unable, or refuses, to install the “Vdoma” app. See the official <a href=""https://www.visitukraine.today/"">Visit Ukraine site  </a> and click “more details” for further information. <br>
During the first 72 hours after arrival (unless travelling from Russia), you can take a PCR or Rapid Antigen test. If you test negative for COVID-19, you will not need to self-isolate. If you do not take a test in those 72 hours, you must begin self-isolating at the address you register on the Vdoma app, for 10 days. You can end self-isolation early if you receive a negative PCR or Rapid Antigen test result. <br>
Unvaccinated travellers (with certain exceptions listed on <a href=""http://visitukraine.today/"">Visit Ukraine</a>) who travel from Russia (including for transit through Ukraine) and have spent 7 or more days of the previous 14 days in those countries, will have to self-isolate for 14 days and will not be able to take a test in Ukraine to avoid or reduce self-isolation. <br>
As of 3 December 2021, foreigners without a residence permit or other exemption (see Visit Ukraine for details) who have spent more than 7 of the last 14 days in South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique or Malawi, are not permitted to enter Ukraine. Those with a residence permit or exemption may enter, but must undergo a mandatory 14-day self-isolation and will not be able to take a test to reduce the period of self-isolation.
*Exemptions for foreign nationals: According to the resolution 1236 (9 December 2020) of the Ukrainian Government (Cabinet of Ministers), as updated on 25 October 2021, certain categories of foreign nationals are exempt from the insurance, PCR/RAT/express testing or vaccination requirements, and do not have to install the “Vdoma” app.<br>
These categories include foreign nationals who are: <br>
•        recognised as refugees; <br>
•        accredited diplomats in Ukraine, or members of accredited diplomats’ families; <br>
•        air, sea, and land transport crews, or; <br>
•        military personnel from NATO or “Partnership for Peace” countries taking part in exercises with the Ukrainian military. <br>
The full list of exemptions is available on <a href=""https://www.visitukraine.today/"">Visit Ukraine</a> (click “more details” and scroll to the bottom). <br>
Foreign nationals who are permanent residents of Ukraine are exempt from the insurance and PCR/RAT testing requirement, though they must provide a document confirming receipt of one or more doses of a recognised COVID-19 vaccine or install the Vdoma mobile app and self-isolate for 10 days. Self-isolation is no longer required if you undergo PCR testing or a rapid antigen test within 72 hours of entry and get a negative result; except for permanent residents of Ukraine on arrival from Russia, who are subject to self-isolation for 14 days without the possibility of early termination. <br>
The final decision on a person’s eligibility to enter Ukraine rests with the Ukrainian State Border Service. The entry requirement policies of foreign governments are imposed and enforced at their discretion.
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Ukraine will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Transiting Ukraine: Foreign nationals transiting Ukraine are required to provide documents confirming their departure from the country within 48 hours and proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. Transiting travellers are exempt from self-isolation, installing the Vdoma application, and undergoing testing in Ukraine. <br>
Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. <br>
Further information about visiting Ukraine during the quarantine period can be found at the Ukrainian authorities’ <a href=""https://visitukraine.today/"">Visit Ukraine webpage</a>.
<br>
<br>
Internal restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Ukraine: Domestic flights are operating, although some carriers are operating a reduced schedule. Public transport in cities and bus and train travel between regions are also operating on a reduced scale. You require a vaccine certificate or negative PCR or express-test taken within 72 hours of travel, if travelling inter-city (by train, bus or plane) to or from a “yellow”, “orange” or “red” zone. <br>
*Quarantine measures: Coronavirus measures are in place until 31 March 2022, but may be extended further. Ukraine is operating a colour-coded adaptive quarantine system on a regional (oblasts and Kyiv city) basis. Quarantine measures may be imposed, and change, at short notice. You should check which restrictions apply to the places you intend to visit, and be ready to prove your vaccination status. <br>
In all zones, the following rules apply: <br>
•        you must carry ID with you at all times <br>
•        when in public buildings (including restaurants, hotels and shops) you must maintain a minimum distance of 1.5 m. <br>
•        when in public buildings, and while travelling on public transport and in taxis, you must wear a protective mask covering your nose and mouth <br>
Failure to comply with restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence. Before taking public transport, you should consider whether you will be able to maintain social distancing. In regions classified as “green” zones, there are minimal restrictions beyond mask-wearing and distancing. <br>
In “yellow” and “orange” zones, mass events are prohibited unless all staff and participants have one of the following: a certificate of full vaccination (within the last 365 days), a certificate of recovery from Covid-19 (within the last 105 days) or a certificate of a negative PCR or rapid-antigen test (within the last 72 hours). The same restrictions apply to the opening of indoor hospitality venues, entertainment and cultural institutions, fitness centres and swimming pools, hostels and guesthouses. <br>
In “red” zones, these measures additionally apply to shopping malls and non-essential retail. Supermarkets and other grocery stores, pharmacies, veterinary supplies shops, banks and petrol stations remain open, as well as parks and public spaces. <br>
Ukraine will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotel accommodation remains open under the present quarantine rules, but hostels may only open in yellow, orange or red zones if all staff and customers are vaccinated. Hotel restaurant facilities are subject to the same rules as other restaurants, and will require a vaccinate certificate or negative Covid test for all customers. When staying in a hotel, you must adhere to the overall rules regarding masks and minimum distancing. If possible, check in online in advance to avoid check-in queues at the hotel. <br>

<br>
International Restrictions:  <br>
*All travellers: You will need to get a visa or an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) visa waiver to enter or transit the USA as a visitor. You should consult the <a href=""https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html"">US State Department website  </a>to determine which you will need. <br>
You should be aware that if you have travelled to or have been in Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen on or after 1 March 2011, you are normally not eligible for an ESTA visa waiver and will need to apply for a US visa. <br>
The US Embassy advise that travellers who come under the following categories should not attempt to travel on an ESTA and should instead apply for a visa: those who have been arrested (even if the arrest did not result in a criminal conviction); those who have a criminal record; those who have been refused admission into, or have been deported from the USA; those who have previously overstayed under an ESTA. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Most fully vaccinated foreign citizens can enter the USA. The US authorities will accept any COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use by the World Health Organisation or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These are the AstraZeneca, BIBP/Sinopharm, Covishield, Janssen, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac vaccines. In addition, those who have received the full series of an active (not placebo) COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca or Novavax COVID-19 vaccine trials are considered vaccinated. More details are on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/noncitizens-US-air-travel.html"">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. Foreign nationals planning to travel to the USA should familiarise themselves with the new requirements on the CDC website before booking any travel. <br>
All current visa holders based in the USA who leave the country and then re-enter will need to follow the vaccine entry requirements unless they have an exception. This includes students on F-1 and M-1 visas and those previously issued with an existing National Interest Exception.<br>
Before boarding a flight to the USA, most passengers - regardless of vaccination status - are required to show a negative COVID-19 test result taken no more than 1 day before travel. All air passengers to the USA are also required to provide contact information to their airlines before boarding. You should check with your airline before you travel for more details. Full requirements for pre-travel testing can be found on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/noncitizens-US-air-travel.html"">CDC website</a>.

*Proof of vaccination status: The USA will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>
The <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/proof-of-vaccination.html"">CDC website</a> lists the forms of acceptable proof of COVID-19 status. This also includes the European Union Digital COVID Certificate. Other accepted methods of proof include a printout of a COVID-19 vaccination record or a COVID-19 vaccination certificate issued at national or subnational level or by an authorized vaccine provider. Alternatively, digital photos of a vaccination card or record, a downloaded vaccine record or a vaccination certificate from an official source (e.g. public health agency, government agency, or other authorised vaccine provider), or a mobile phone application without a QR code. All forms of COVID-19 status must have a personal identifier, at a minimum including full name and date of birth, that match the information on a passenger’s passport or other travel documents. It must also include the name of the official source issuing the record and the vaccine manufacturer and date(s) of vaccination.<br>

If a child is not fully vaccinated and traveling alone or with adults who are not fully vaccinated, they will have to show proof of a negative viral test from a sample taken within one day of departure. <br>
If a child (17 and under) is travelling with only one parent or someone who isn’t a parent or legal guardian, you may be asked to provide certain documents at the border.

<br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in USA: Many airports in the USA have implemented safety measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should check the website of the airport you are flying into or transiting to see how these could affect you. <br>
On 21 January 2021 President Biden signed an Executive Order requiring masks to be worn on public transport including airplanes, trains, buses and at airports. <br>
A number of US states no longer mandate the use of masks and face coverings while in public. However, the guidance will vary from state to state and there can often be different rules within different localities in the same state. You should consult the website of the state or city to which you are travelling. Further details are found on the  
<a href=""https://www.usa.gov/states-and-territories"">USA.GOV</a> site. Penalties for breaches of regulations will vary between each state and may sometimes vary in different areas in the same state. <br>
Some areas require proof of vaccination in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children 5 to 17 years may not be exempt from this requirement. Some private venues, including restaurants and concert halls, have made proof of vaccination (or a recent negative COVID-19 test result) a requirement for entry. The precise requirements may vary from venue to venue so you should check on compliancy requirements in advance. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels will be operating at capacities dictated by local rules and regulations. <br>
Public places and services: Local regulations on shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities may be following measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Some areas require proof of vaccination or evidence of a negative COVID-19 test in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children aged 5 to 17 years may not be exempt from this requirement. <br>
*If you test positive while in the USA, you may be required to isolate in a private area, likely a hotel or a private residence. Isolation requirements will depend on the guidance in the state where you are residing/visiting. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a minimum isolation period of at least five full days. Any assistance for those required to quarantine will depend on the local authority. You should check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-planner/index.html"""">travel planner</a> to verify local state guidance.

  <br>
 International Restrictions: <br>
 *All travellers: You don’t need a visa to enter Israel/The Occupied Palestinian Territories as a tourist. On entry, visitors are granted leave to enter for a period of up to 3 months. <br>
Visitors entering via Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport are given an entry card instead of an entry stamp in their passport. While this practice is in place at other ports of entry, there have been instances where passports have been stamped for entry purposes. You should keep your entry card with your passport until you leave. This is evidence of your legal entry into Israel and may be required, particularly at any crossing points into the Occupied Palestinian Territories. If you’re refused entry into Israel, your passport may be stamped with an entry stamp and two red lines drawn across it to indicate the refusal. <br>
It is for the Israeli authorities to determine the right of entry into Israel, if you have any particular concerns about visas or entry into Israel. If you work in Israel without the proper authority, you can be detained and then deported, a process which could take several months. Consular staff will not be able to help you enter Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories. They are unable get involved in another country’s immigration policy or procedures. <br>
At the Allenby Bridge crossing with Jordan, as well as at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport, Israeli border officials have on occasions used an entry stamp for certain travellers that states ‘Palestinian Authority only’ or ‘Judea and Samaria only’. Since travellers entering via the Allenby Bridge crossing must pass through Israeli checkpoints and Israeli-controlled territory to reach Jerusalem or Gaza, this restriction effectively limits travellers who receive this stamp. It is not clear how a traveller receiving the stamp at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport can leave the airport without violating the restriction. This stamp has been issued to travellers who have no Palestinian or other Arab ancestry, and who would not seem to have any claim to a Palestinian Authority ID. <br>
Israeli border officials at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport have also at times required certain travellers to sign a form that states that he/she is not allowed to enter territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority unless he/she obtains advance authorisation from the Israeli ‘Territory Actions Co-ordinator’, and that violating this restriction may result in the traveller being deported from Israel and barred from entry for up to 10 years. In March 2017 the Israeli Parliament passed a law which gives authority to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott. <br>
Emergency Travel Documents: Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories unless the holder is a returning resident. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Israel. <br>
Previous Travel to Other Countries: Evidence of a previous visit to another country in the region like an entry/exit stamp in your passport does not normally prevent entry into Israel, although it may lead to additional questioning at the border. It is for the Israeli authorities to determine the right of entry into Israel, so if you have any particular concerns about previous travel to another country, you should contact the Israeli embassies . <br>
Customs and Immigration: You should expect lengthy personal questioning and baggage searches by security officials on arrival and departure from Israel. Electrical items, including laptops, may be taken from departing passengers for security inspection and either stored in the aircraft baggage hold, or returned to your country. Damage may occur. <br>
If you arrive with valuable personal items (computers, camcorders etc.) you may be required to pay a deposit that is refundable on or after departure. <br>
Israeli security officials have on occasion requested access to travellers’ personal e-mail accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of entry. <br>
Entry to the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs), including by sea to Gaza, is controlled by the Israeli authorities. You must produce a passport and immigration slip, to cross between Israel and the OPTs. <br>
You may be detained on arrival and deported if you are intending to enter Gaza without permission. If you’re entering the country for the purpose of working in the OPTs, you may be refused entry. For more information, contact the nearest Israeli Embassy.<br>
Dual nationals: dual nationals living in the West Bank and Gaza are allowed to travel abroad only via the Rafah or Allenby Bridge border crossings into Egypt or Jordan and return via the same route. <br>
Children with Israeli parents (father and/or mother) are considered to be Israeli nationals. The Israeli Ministry of Interior insists that these children enter and leave Israel on an Israeli passport.<br>
If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter to The Occupied Palestinian Territories. <br>
Non-Israeli citizens will need to present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours before the flight to Israel. These tests must be performed by a professional test lab in the origin country and should state the full name and passport number of the passenger. Self, home tests will not be accepted. <br>
All travellers must have a health insurance policy with coverage for the treatment of COVID-19. The insurance policy is mandatory to enter Israel. You are required to fill out an <a href=""https://corona.health.gov.il/en/flights/"">entry statement form  </a> within 48 hours before your flight to Israel. <br>
On arrival in Israel, you must take a further PCR test before leaving the airport, at your own expense. You can make the payment after you submit the entry statement form prior to traveling to Israel. Payment in advance is at a reduced price. Only PCR tests are admissible. <br>
All passengers must enter home isolation until the results of their PCR test arrive, or 24 hours have passed. If the result of the test is positive the individual will be required to remain in home isolation for a minimum of 14 days, although this can be reduced by taking a second PCR test on day 7. Entrants from ‘red’ locations may be required to isolate in a government facility. <br>
Full guidance on requirements upon arrival is regularly updated online. Check <a href=""https://www.gov.il/en/departments/population_and_immigration_authority"">Israeli Population and Immigration Authority</a> pages and the dedicated <a href=""https://corona.health.gov.il/en/directives/air-travel-covid19-israel/"">COVID-19 Air Transport website</a>  for full details. Further restrictions may be introduced at short notice. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Israel/The Occupied Palestinian Territories to receive a Green Pass. The Green Pass will exempt individuals from isolation if they come into contact with a COVID patient during their stay in Israel. <br>
You can use the proof of COVID-19 vaccination record to demonstrate your vaccination status when entering Israel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>
If you hold a verifiable digital certificate proving vaccination status, this should be scanned or uploaded along with the entry declaration. If you do not have a verifiable digital certificate, you should declare the vaccinations you have received in the entry declaration form and attach all relevant documentation. You will then receive a Green Pass prior to boarding your flight. <br>
Entry via Land Borders: Restrictions also apply at land crossings between Israel and Jordan, and between the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Jordan. You can find the latest guidance on entering and exiting Israel via the land borders on the <a href=""https://corona.health.gov.il/en/directives/leaving-israel/#sea-and-land"">Israeli Ministry of Health’s website</a>
