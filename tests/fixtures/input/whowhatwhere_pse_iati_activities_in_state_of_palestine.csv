Wadi Salman, one of the most vulnerable communities in Area C, will be targeted in this intervention. This community is extremely exposed to protection threats including risks of demolitions from the Israeli Civil administration and the risks of forcible transfers. It is also suffers from severe weather conditions. Vulnerable families’ access to safe, adequate, and healthy shelter spaces will be improved through the project activities, ensuring protection and dignity for all family members. The intervention will provide a full coverage to the shelter needs in the community and all families will receive assistance to rehabilitate their own shelters.  Female-headed HHs will be targeted, using AAH material assistance ranking tool which will play an integral part in the selection and design of project activities based on the customized needs. The project activities will be articulated around the provision of urgent rehabilitation and upgrade assistance of the existing shelters prioritizing vulnerable groups in the community with customized solutions. Specifically, the intervention will provide rehabilitation for 67 shelters in the community covering 67 families (292 beneficiaries: men 81, women 80, boys 67, girls 64) based on a full coverage/solution for shelter needs in the community through a mixed approach of cash and in-kind assistance. This intervention will improve the living conditions of the families and would contribute to removing the community from the list of communities categorized for urgent shelter needs allowing for focus on other communities in future interventions. The intervention will also address WASH needs in the targeted facilities by upgrading WASH facilities in the shelters.

In addition, the project comes in line with the pillars of the Inter Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG) Action Plan for Hebron H2 area. This project presents a pioneering intervention in intersectoral collaboration (WASH in Agriculture) in Area C by providing access to sewer services for vulnerable households (HHs) alongside providing more opportunities for agricultural and irrigation solutions as well as introducing solutions to enhance the communities’ resilience to the negative consequences of climate change and supporting more environment-friendly practices in Area C. Through this project, vulnerable families living in H2 and in Um Sidra will have improved access to sanitation and hygiene services, in particular the families living in the ‘closed military zone’. In addition, the project targets Um Sidra community in Hebron governorate to provide a sewer network system with a treatment plan that would assist the community in securing access to a sewer system and in providing more environment friendly living conditions as well as assisting the community in agriculture in terms of securing processed water for agricultural usage.

Despite their central role in poverty alleviation, grassroots women’s rights organisations remain severely under-funded, with an average income of just $20,000 per year. This lack of resources binds them into a negative spiral where they are unable to invest in their own staff and organisations, limiting their ability to plan ahead and access sustained funding. The new GSF of Oxfam clearly highlights to transform the way it works, as well as what it supports. Devolving more resources and power to local organisations and disrupting the way we work as an INGO is core to the new vision for Oxfam.  This initiative would be one of the first deliberate commitments to test and learn how to deliver on this promise to purposefully move power and resources to the people weserve. This project aims to help grassroots women’s rights organisations (WROs) to gain access to flexible funding, allowing them to invest in the priority needs of women and girls, while becoming stronger and more sustainable. The project in oPt will work with 2-3 WROs in urban, peri-urban and rural areas.  It will offer small flexible funding of between £10,000 - £15,000 per organisation/ per year.

With such changes, there is a need to reviewthe targeting criteria adopted by the Ministry of Social Development (MoSD), to better include the changes in the socioeconomic situation at the household level.\nEfficiency: the increasing level of vulnerabilities and collapse in different sectors, families are losing their livelihoodmeans, indicating that the quarterly intervention is not efficiently helping families to meet their needs, especially with familiesthat solely depend on this cash transfer.\nCritically analysing the approach adopted by thePNCTP through evidence-based studies can influence the MoSD to review their framework and allow #new or old# vulnerable families to be included within the PNCTP, to ensure better inclusion of vulnerable families within this program. In addition, it willprovide a framework to better understand the level of increasing needs at the household level and the shift on these needs to ensure more efficiency of the PNCTP intervention to meet those needs.

Due to a lack of schools and a severe classroom shortage in some areas of the Palestinian Territory, many schools in different regions are overpopulated. Over the last years the shortage of school buildings in the West Bank has decreased, though infrastructure needs in East Jerusalem and Gaza remain high. Furthermore, quality still needs attention to adapt the schools to a new way of teaching, technology, and curriculum.\n\nBelgium is active in school construction since 2001 and so far, built 23 new schools in the West Bank including one climate adapted pilot school. The Phase IV schools construction project will build 10 schools and will focus on quality through an environment and child friendly design while experimenting innovative and eco-sustainable solutions. The project will also invest in capacity building for designers and teachers and organize activities for students and communities benefitting from the new schools. Special attention will be paid to interactions between schools and communities, to gender, and to energy efficiency and other environment-related aspects.\n\nAn ESS (equivalent student sufferings) software has been developed to identify the areas with the highest needs in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The results were used to make a priority list and accordingly three local design consultants prepared the drawings and tender documents for 7 new schools (including one vocational) in the West Bank and 9 rehabilitations in East Jerusalem. Due to the political situation, no schools in Gaza have been selected yet.\n\nIn addition the project will construct 2 schools and 8 kindergarten classrooms in Area C (Israeli controlled area in the West Bank). Finally, to meet the quality objective, a design competition is held for one eco-sustainable secondary girls’ school with multi-purpose sports hall and environment lab. The schools will be built, furnished, and equipped and include specialized rooms & facilities (science and computer lab, library, multi-purpose room, …).\n\nAs part of a bridging programme, a 4.5m€ top-up has been brought to the project. This will complement the ongoing activities in East Jerusalem, where schools will be rehabilitated and expanded, one new school will be created and four Fab-Labs created inside the schools, promoting STEAM, 21st century skills and Project-Based Learning.\n\nThe direct beneficiaries of this project are more than 7.360 students, who are, or will be enrolled in those schools. The indirect beneficiaries are the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, headmasters, teachers, and the related Palestinian communities.",PS,Palestine,35.2,31.9,111,11120,BE-BCE_KBO-0264814354-PZA1203211

Contributing to both objectives constitutes the backbone of the bilateral cooperation in the Local Government sector in the Palestinian Territory. \n\nSince 2001, Belgium tries to facilitate and strengthen collaboration mechanisms between local government units, with a particular focus on the smaller local authorities. The Local Government Reform and Development Program (LGRDP) started in mid-2011, ran until 2015 and has been followed by a second phase until December 2020. It has continuously adapted itself to the evolving realities and  challenges as well as to an increasingly fine-tuned understanding of a highly complex situation.\n\nLGRDP I supported the Ministry of Local Government policies in the collaboration between villages through Joint Service Councils is seen as a first step for capacity building of local governments – in particular the smaller rural local government units – to improve service provision, promote local development, including villages in area C (Israeli controlled). \n\nThrough LGRDP II, the Palestinian Authority has adopted several policies as tools for promoting inter-village arrangements and cluster planning processes, which was supported by Enabel and implemented in different clusters. Through ARD (Area Resilience Development) Initiative, part of LGRDP II, formal clustering of villages, municipalities and communities in area C was generated in the framework of designing Cluster’s Development Plan. Such dynamic is directly integrating and strengthening the territory not only seen as a space to be administrated but also as a space for development initiatives.\n\nBy end of 2020, and based on the Palestinian and Belgian cooperation, both parties decided to extend LGRDP II, where the programme extension will focus on environment and climate change and contribute to developing more green, resilient, and sustainable municipalities and territories.",PS,Palestine,35.2,31.9,151,15110,BE-BCE_KBO-0264814354-PZA1303311

More than 12 years of siege and closure, restrictions on movement, imports and exports, combined with problems in water and electricity have jeopardized any development in Gaza. In addition, the three destructive wars affected negatively the growth of the Gazan economy. Given this complicated situation, talking about economic growth for Gaza can, in fact, be seen as something unrealistic and unachievable. The business sector at present is too weak and too small to play a dynamic or stimulating role in Gaza. Talking about economic resilience is more applicable and feasible and should be set as priority.\n\nSAWA is a 3-year project with a budget of 1,650,000 EUR, which aims to contribute to economic resilience in the Gaza Strip through enhancing the resilience and sustainability of micro businesses in the Gaza Strip and initiating sustainable and innovative green/circular economy initiatives.\n\nThe project will meet the urgent needs of the most vulnerable population in marginalized communities through focusing on niches among the initiatives of the selected beneficiaries. In parallel, it will facilitate new economic growth opportunities in the field of circular and green economies by providing green solutions to problems identified by the industrial sector and by creating new business opportunities for innovative green entrepreneurs.\n\nSAWA will be implemented in a partnership with experienced civil society organizations in Gaza Strip following a community-based approach in which their capacity will be upgraded in the field of business development services and green/circular economy allowing them to deliver high quality services to their communities.
