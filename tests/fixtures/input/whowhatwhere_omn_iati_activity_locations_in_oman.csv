The water problems in the world, particularly in countries around the equator, mean that 1.2 billion people do not have access to clean drinking water. Unfortunately, current methods of purifying water are not sustainable because they use fossil fuels and waste products. In this way, they also contribute indirectly to the problem, rather than solving it.The beneficiary of this project, Port of Sohar, is looking for ways to become self-sufficient in clean water, in order to increase water security. In addition to drinking water facilities, noting that the company possibly aspires to have an additional distribution of bottled water, clean water is necessary for industrial processes, for the cleaning of a field of solar panels and for the horticulture plans of Port of Sohar. Water security has a major impact for the company but also for the wider environment, including drinking water facilities, cleaner industrial processes (wastewater reuse) and a more sustainable horticulture.In this pilot project, Kascade and MEDRC test the Solar Still under the practical conditions, namely: extreme temperatures, sun, seawater and sand. The developments and innovations that have emerged from the R&D together with TU Delft will be tested on operation, efficiency and sustainability. Although a large number of future customers have indicated that they want to purchase the Solar Still, they want to see practical results that underpin the theoretical (scientific) basis of the Solar Still.
