This fifth phase of the project will focus on labor-intensive road rehabilitation activities and small rehabilitation works in host communities. Furthermore, various accompanying measures and trainings for Syrians and Jordanians are planned. The participation rate of 50% refugees in all activities of the project is also intended to promote social cohesion. The measures will be carried out in continuation of the previous phases of the program in the governorates of Amman, Irbid, Mafraq and Zarqa and will be complemented by the governorate of Karak, which also hosts a relatively high proportion of Syrian refugees and has high vulnerability rates.

Office for the Coordination on Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) regional support to the Syria crisis continued to provide support in policy, planning, operational coordination and administrative services to humanitarian organizations across the response. It brings together humanitarian organizations working from within and outside Syria to develop a shared analysis, common objectives and a collective focus on results. The regional support focuses on enhancing its engagement and coordination with key regional stakeholders in the response, namely UN Regional Directors, international NGOs, Member States and donors.",JO,Amman,36.238415,30.585163,720,72050,XM-DAC-41127-O569

Qudra is an Arabic word meaning ‘strength, ‘ability’ or ‘resilience.’\n\nQudra II will be implemented by five European Development Agencies, including Enabel, and is jointly co-financed by the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis (EUTF Syria also referred to as EC Madad), the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID). The programme will be implemented in four countries bordering Syria; Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq. Enabel’s action will be implemented in Jordan over a period of 36 months.\n\nThe Overall Objective of Qudra II is “To contribute to mitigating the destabilizing effects of the protracted Syrian and Iraqi crisis and to better respond to the resilience needs of refugees, internally displaced persons (IDP), returnees and host communities”. This will be achieved through improving education and protection opportunities, employment and income generation opportunities, capacities of local governmental institutions and civil society organizations to deliver services, and social community cohesion in targeted areas, for targeted youth and women in particular.\n\nGiven the contextual impact of migration of Syrian refugees, with Jordan being the second highest host of refugees’ share per capita in the world, the protracted Syrian crisis has affected the relationship between Syrian and Jordanian communities, their access to public services including education and vocational training, and labor market employment opportunities. The labor market situation in Jordan features 19% unemployment rate and 34.5% unemployment rate amongst youth population (20-24 years old), while unemployment rates among Syrian refugees residing in Jordan is 60%.\n\nTherefore, Enabel’s contribution will be harnessed towards enhancing employment and income outcomes for Syrian and Jordanian vulnerable youth and women. Action’s Interventions revolve around improving the relevance of vocational training and facilitate the transition from the world of training to the world of work for targeted group. This will be achieved through enhancing the involvement of local organizations in the private sector through building partnerships, utilizing work-based learning approaches and developing demand-driven, work-based vocational training programs. The program aims at training 2,000 Syrian and Jordanian vulnerable youth and women on semi-skilled work to better equip them with the skills and knowledge that match identified local labour market needs. Demand-driven vocational training programs will be delivered by contracted local private and public vocational training centers. Moreover, the program aims at enhancing the capacity of local private enterprises in Human Resource Management (HRM) as part of its holistic approach to create a more favorable working environment resembling improved employee retention rates and productivity.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/QudraProgramme/posts/799122160665628 \nYouTube Channel: https://bit.ly/3eZRyNq",JO,Jordan,36,31,113,11330,BE-BCE_KBO-0264814354-JOR180011T

Children from Syrian refugee communities don´t have equal access to the educational system and they show worse performance in schools. Insufficient physical capacity of the schools to accept new students as well as unsuitable and damaged educational and sanitary infrastructure in schools has been identified by Jordan´s Ministry of Education to be at the root of these issues. The main goal of this project is to improve the schooling environment in communities with high concentration of Syrian refugees through rehabilitation of infrastructure in primary schools. The project will enable a safe and healthy educational environment for approximately 2,000 children attending 8 primary schools in low income areas of Amman, The project will focus mainly on reconstruction of educational and sanitary facilities, access to drinkable water through water tanks and water filters, electricity installation, roof repairs and installation of safety elements in schools.",JO,Amman,35.94503,31.95522,160,16050,XM-DAC-69-2-2016000140

Saline Farming focuses on innovating agriculture under increasingly saline conditions. Four factors are important here:1. choice of crop and variety;2. method of tillage;3. fertilization and4. irrigation.Saline Farming validated and partly enhanced the knowledge developed on Texel in several countries. The same is currently being done in Jordan.The consortium consists of 3 organisations. Saline Farming will act as the secretary.Nectearra (www.nectearra.com) provides various services related to water and groundwater, specifically focused on research and advice in matters such as exploration, extraction and management of groundwater, smart water management and 3R (recharge, retention, reuse) and agroforestry.

Delphy (www.delphy.com) provides various research, advice and training services for flower, fruit and vegetable cultivation at home and abroad.The three partners operate as partners under a largely shared project management.The National Agricultural Research Center NARC has a very strong network in the country and ample knowledge of the local conditions and local agricultural practice. In addition, NARC also has a huge outreach to the farmers. After all, they must operate under the salty conditions.This consortium aims to introduce the pioneering innovations in crops and cultivation techniques under salinizing conditions in Jordan. Saline Farming introduces new cultivation techniques. Nectaerra contributes to knowledge development of water availability, efficiency and management and agroforestry. Delphy supports this development with agricultural and commercial knowledge. The local knowledge and network of NARC provides fast upscaling options.The salt farming approach supervises the testing of the technical and commercial feasibility of the combined agro-water solutions in saline cultivation, water management and agroforestry. The possibility of scaling will be determined. In the short term, the feasibility will be tested at two locations, one NARC farm and one NARC research centre. Furthermore, the locations will be used to scale up the approach through training, capacity building and demonstration. Knowledge validation and expansion under local circumstances is of course an important part of this. The long-term goal is to develop a system in which the effective transfer of innovative knowledge of farming solutions to the agricultural sector is possible. Meanwhile effective partnerships will be built to give farmers access to attractive forms of financing to make the necessary improvements under the guidance of the consortium. In the long term, the consortium strives to create a revenue model that, in addition to training and advice, also generates income from farm inputs.•\tInitial activities and results of the projectThe work includes 5 main activities:- WP1: Data collection, exploratory analysis and kick-off mission (the Netherlands / Jordan);- WP2: Design & realization of climate smart saline land and water management on 2 farms (the Netherlands / Jordan);- WP3: Natural capacity accounting (NCA) & food-water-energy analysis (the Netherlands);- WP4: Commercial research and preparation 3E-Center (the Netherlands / Jordan);- WP5: Final report, conclusions, recommendations and follow-up (the Netherlands).Bulk of the work takes place in WP2, 3 and 4. In WP2 the feasibility of the solution under local agricultural conditions is proven on 2 saline farms during one harvest period, in WP3 the effects of this are compared to normal cultivation by natural (land and water) capital accounting, and in WP4 the operating model and implementation of a 3E-Center are tested for feasibility.Cooperation with the Jordanian Ministry of Agriculture (National Agricultural Research Center; NARC) is decisive in all activities. They provide in-kind facilities for this and support with commercial preparations and partnership formation for a broad roll-out. The facilities include 2 farms: one in the Jordan Valley (Northwest of Amman) which is commercially run, and one farm at Al Mafraq (Northeast of Amman) used as a research site.",JO,null,35.94503,31.95522,311,31140,NL-KVK-27378529-PVW4S19080
