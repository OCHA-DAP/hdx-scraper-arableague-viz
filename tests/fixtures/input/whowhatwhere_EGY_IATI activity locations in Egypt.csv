In the first component, two sectoral Centers of Competence in the area of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency will be established in Hurghada and Aswan. In the second component, Technical Education Schools in the regions of Cairo, Alexandria and Gharbia will be upgraded and their job-market relevance will be improved. Œ ŒThe project applies the KfW school building standards in the sense of a child- and youth-friendly, fully functional design. In addition, special attention is paid to increased energy efficiency in the school buildings. Depending on requirements, additional premises will be created which will enable the school, for example, to cooperate with companies, to provide competence-based teaching, to have sufficient space for the number of pupils and to provide the technical equipment for the expansion of new teaching activities. Training and further training for teachers will be provided within the project for the pedagogical use, operation, maintenance and repair of the technical facilities.",EG,Cairo,31.24967,30.06263,113,11330,DE-1-201565217

In addition, an agreement on agricultural and processed agricultural products entered into effect 2010. Egypt’s exporter base is a vital component to make use of these opportunities to spur economic growth, improving participation within the economy and generating employment. However, the export readiness of companies needs to be addressed in order to achieve competitiveness and to add value. Bottlenecks both exist at the company level, for example in terms of compliance to requirements and marketing capacities, as well as on the institutional level, in terms of trust, strategic cooperation, and linkages.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Ecorys study, the Egyptian government appointed five priority sectors to develop an export strategy. Among them are (processed) agricultural products, textiles and garments and chemicals. Furthermore, Ecorys identified natural ingredients, garments and household and furnishing articles as high potential sectors for Egypt. This corresponds to a great extent with the projects selected within the programme: 1) engineering products, 2) natural ingredients and 3) crafts.\n\nAlthough garments was selected as a high-potential sector, CBI will not commence activities in this sector in Egypt. \n\n\n\nSince strong development opportunities exist for the three mentioned sectors, three projects have been designed, along the three pillars of the CBI mandate: export promotion, sustained success, and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The main premise is that the CBI projects in Egypt are combined in a country programme, instead of combining sector activities in regional programmes. This is needed because of the specific nature of the Egyptian economy ([political] instabilities, weak sector organisation and strategy, and weak cooperation between companies and government-led export councils). CBI succeeded in attracting sufficient companies in order to start up projects for two of the three sectors namely 1) Engineering (the Engineering Egypt project) and 2) Crafts (the Home Decoration & Home Textiles Egypt Project, HDHT). \n\n\n\nThe projects include Human Resource Development, Export Coaching and Market Intelligence interventions (removing company internal obstacles and obstacles in the business environment). Moreover, Strategic Conferences have a prominent role in the projects to address cooperation in the sector and lacking sector strategies. The Home Decoration & Home Textiles Egypt Project specifically includes the option to move beyond this level, to the establishment and support of a platform for cooperation in the sector.",EG,null,30.802498,26.820553,430,43081,NL-KVK-27378529-CBIEG1

With a projected doubling of its population to 200 million by 2050, Egypt faces unsurmountable challenges to provide food security and nutrition in a very water scarce and deteriorating environment. This deterioration can be seen in the ongoing reduction and salinization of the fresh water resources that are available mostly directly near the Nile and in the Delta. The water management practices are overwhelmingly unsustainable in a race to the bottom. To add to these problems are the effects of climate change and more erratic and scarce rainfall events, and the gradual decline of water reaching the Nile from Ethiopia because of the GERD dam.Under these circumstances it is evident that Egypt needs to become much more water efficient and also improve its efficiency in utilizing available brackish groundwater resources for food production. The proposed interventions consist of Dutch technology on saline agriculture, smart water management and agroforestry (DESALT), that allow higher crop yields and quality under saline conditions, while using less water and recycling water, and providing higher soil fertility and resilience. These benefits are of direct and primary interest to Egypt.The target group is the entire Egyptian agricultural sector consisting of small to large companies in the main, existing farming areas (Nile and Delta) and in the rest of Egypt (marginal lands and new land development).The showcasing of DESALT is an essential first step to improvement, as farmers will only change their practices after seeing better results elsewhere. This project intends to showcase DESALT and establish a commercial venture and business case in saline crops on two farms (Wadi and Sekem). The project subsequently engages in capacity building among the agricultural and water sector in Egypt, provides DESALT workshops and training, and builds a supply business around farming inputs and training materials. Beyond the scope of the Impact, the DESALT Consortium can provide business-to-business consulting services to farmers or industry.The selection of project partners Wadi and Sekem is done to help guarantee that the project comes to fruition.
