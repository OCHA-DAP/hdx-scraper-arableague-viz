LWP will assist RWEs with offsetting their current halt of revenues by decreasing their operational costs. LWP will support the RWEs with infrastructure upgrades, equipment procurement, and essential spare parts provision that save on the RWEs operation costs. For instance, LWP will provide photovoltaic panels for essential pumping stations to reduce the need for diesel run electric generators. LWP will also implement a number of interventions to reduce network leakages by upgrading/repair of selected existing networks and expanding on its current scope to install production and household meters.

The intervention will also be complemented with Water Awareness Sessions facilitated by the ADRA Lebanon team. The goal is to promote positive water practices amongst Syrians and Lebanese encouraging the conservation of water and development of safe practices and sanitation. Through this activity, ADRA will target a total of 200 individuals (adults and children). The targeted village is selected due to the presence of high numbers of Syrian refugees living in the area who suffer from poverty. Before the influx of refugees, the Lebanese host-community in the area was considered as one of the most vulnerable due to their poorly serviced community. The essential services are now strained causing a high concentration of people with no/poor access to sufficient quantity/quality of basic services. In addition, Syrian refugees living in the area rely on UN/NGO-provided water trucks, private trucking or bottled mineral water as their primary source of water. This limits the water consumption and increases the expenditures for each household. Therefore, the construction of the reservoir and its connection to the existing water network will provide the village with sufficient capacity to store water from its water wells to provide clean and safe water.",LB,Râs Baalbek,36.41917,34.25889,720,72010,XM-DAC-69-2-2019000151

The combination of a dry food parcel distribution and a voucher scheme for fruits and vegetables will contribute to reducing malnutrition and negative coping strategies among target beneficiary groups. The voucher approach will also support the resilience of the communities at large through increased economic activity to local businesses and the reduction of food waste compared to in-kind fruit and vegetable distribution. Furthermore, to support ongoing mitigation efforts against the spread of COVID-19 and to improve hygiene practices Hygiene, Baby, and Elderly Kits with instructions for use will be provided alongside the dry food parcels and fruit and vegetable vouchers. CARE will leverage its extensive experience in such interventions through our current roaster of projects to ensure the timely and quality assured implementation of the project, also leaning on our experience with LHF 2020 allocation. In this proposed intervention and in line with CIL’s partnership approach of implementing through partners, CIL shall be responsible for the implementation of the work plan, building and refining of RMF’s capacities, procuring the food parcel and WASH kits, preparing the ( Information Education and Communication) IEC materials, disseminating the crosscutting messages and awareness sessions, validating the vulnerability assessments scoring, and selecting the eligible beneficiaries, as well as field monitoring of the distribution and leading the PDM process whilst RMF will be responsible for the outreach activities, identification of beneficiaries (through internal and external referrals provided by CIL) and organizing field and door-to-door distributions of the food parcels, vouchers, and WASH kits.CIL identified the main areas of capacity building required for RMF through the initial OCA conducted for RMF technical support will be provided by CIL staff or external consultants during the first month of the project.

Specifically, the action aims to improve access to nutritionally balanced food, by distributing dry food parcels, paired with wash kits, and complemented with fresh fruit and vegetables to 621 vulnerable HHs in the mentioned areas, for six months. Moreover, the intervention will be providing dry food parcels paired with WASH kits to 85 HHs with individuals Covid-19 positive or at high risk of contracting the virus. The intervention addresses critical gaps and meets the needs of vulnerable groups, especially targeting families with children, pregnant and lactating women and elderly people with chronic diseases, offering support to HHs who do not currently receive assistance from NGOs or the Government in neglected areas.\nThe project will directly target 3036 individuals, while the number of indirect beneficiaries is calculated to be 342. It is proposed to increase access to core relief and Covid-19/Hygiene items for the most vulnerable HHs where individuals are Covid-19 positive and isolating at home or at high risk of contracting Covid-19. In this case, two parcels will be guaranteed per month instead of one.\nSpecifically, the project will contribute to cover the needs identified and described in detail below by identifying the most vulnerable households through a participatory approach (FGDs and KIIs with the communities, local authorities and key informants), and then validating them, in the most vulnerable municipalities of the Union of Jabal Akroum (in brackets the tentative target for each municipality, which will be subject to changes during the implementation due to the real needs and the Covid-19 cases in each municipality) : Sahleh (27), Mouanse (18), Qinye (24), El Bsatine (5), Mrah El Khaoukh (7), Kfartoun (65), Akroum (55), and in the Union of Municipalities of Joumeh: Akkar El Aatiqa (197), Ed Daoura (60), Aaiyat (64), Ain Yaaqoub (17), Borj El Arab (21), attached the map (Annex 2.

WW-GVC aims to support its local partner during the first weeks of implementation, training its staff in the areas of Procurements and MampE, according to its requirements and needs.\nThe distribution will be conducted by WW-GVC staff, together with the support of MADA and volunteers employed by the Municipalities. Distributions will be made at secure distribution points or, for the most vulnerable, will be carried out door-to-door. The distribution of fresh vegetables will be conducted twice a week for both modalities, over 6 months, counting two different sets of vegetables. Every WASH and Covid-19 kits will also include awareness leaflets guiding on hygiene good practices and social distancing, vaccination, and any other pertinent information. \nThe strategy has been developed in collaboration with all relevant actors. Coordination with the Food Security Cluster and its members, as well as communication with the Municipalities, MoSA, SDCs and the ONGs operating in Akkar, have been carried out during the design of this proposal and will continue during its implementation.

Fresh produce - fruits and vegetables (FampV) will be provided through local supermarkets via a voucher system worth $50 per month per HH, in line with the June 2021 costing estimated by the Food Security Sector.\nAnera will follow necessary health precautions and safety measures in both distribution modalities (including distancing, use of PPEs and crowd management). \nVerified delivery notes, stock control, and distribution receipts will be the basis of monthly distribution monitoring and reporting. Within 30 days of the distribution, Anera's team will conduct a post-distribution evaluation with a sample of beneficiaries to measure the immediate impact of the assistance.\n\nThe project will be implemented in partnership with 4 local organizations which will primarily handle distribution. Anera will also mobilize a team of 20 trained youth (through UNICEF-funded cash for work activities) to help in HH identification, baseline assessment, and post-distribution assessment. \n\nAnera's management and operations team in Beirut will lead the development of tools, competitive procurement, finance and compliance management, MEAL, and reporting.\n\nAnera will leverage its solid relationships with the local NGOs with which Anera has had successful previous experiences in food distribution and which have the infrastructure that facilitates orderly distributions (outreach, space, logistic support, etc.). For safe and proper implementation of the project, Anera will implement a capacity building plan targeting all partner organizations prioritizing PSEA, COVID-19, accountability and reporting, and anti-fraud/anti-corruption policies and practices\n\nFor the purpose of alignment and complementarity, Anera coordinated with several stakeholders in designing this project including FSS, Amel, IMC, Nabaa, Care, UNRWA and Welfare. Anera has also discussed the project with IOM and has recently joined the Migrant Workers Coordination Group.\n\n\n*NOTE*: In estimating targets, Anera had to comply with the budget ceiling limit of $1Million, per LHF 'Operational Modalities' guidelines. However, with the same staffing level, Anera has the capacity to serve a wider target (up to 1,700 HH) in the whole of Greater Beirut, expanding the target group to include COVID-19 positive, at-risk or isolated HH (complemented with hygiene kits) for 2 months.",LB,Beirut,35.5131,33.8869,430,43010,XM-OCHA-CBPF-LEB-21/DDA-3604/SA1/FS/INGO/18767

ADJI will sensitize caregivers and communities on CwDs' rights to strengthen the child protection mechanisms and to decrease attitudes preventing social inclusion. ADJI will cooperate with community leaders/influencers to advocate for children with disabilities' rights, link them with service providers, and ensure PSEA implementation.\nSince ADJI is adopting a centered approach, children who need additional services will be referred either internally to a community-based rehabilitation project or externally to a service provider who offers the requested services using RIMS.\n\nAlso, ADJI has permanent permission from MEHE (Annex 1) to provide awareness sessions in public schools about CwDs rights and inclusion concept, throughout the project ADJI will sensitize students in 5 public schools in North on child protection, CwDs, and appreciating diversity. CwDs supported by PSS officers/ assistants will conduct some sessions that will help in building themselves esteems. Moreover, various activities will be implemented to advocate for children's rights, children with disabilities integration, and inclusion in social lives such as sports activities, puppet shows, talent shows..etc. All the activities aim to promote child protection and to demolish the stereotypes about CwDs' capabilities and promote their rights and social inclusion.\n\nAt the beginning of the project, all CwDs will receive PSS materials and will be supplied with assistive technologies (including the provision of tablets, accounts in Edmodo, and follow-up on various online platforms..etc). During physical attendance, ADJI will provide specialized transportation for the children to bring them from and to the center in a safe manner.

They also aim to empower women and girls on cognitive, psychosocial, and socio-economic levels. \nIMC’s GBV response will consist of case management services using a survivor-centered approach, in line with global interagency guidelines, to help survivors recover from incidents of violence and prevent additional harm. IMC uses innovative and tested women empowerment counseling tools as part of the PSS support offered within case management. When needed and applicable, case management will include the provision of a one-time emergency cash assistance (ECA), where socio-economic vulnerability interacts with and/or exacerbates a protection risk. IMC has previous experience in offering ECA and is familiar with the protection sector guidelines for the provision of emergency cash assistance. Focused PSS activities will be offered to women and girls.
