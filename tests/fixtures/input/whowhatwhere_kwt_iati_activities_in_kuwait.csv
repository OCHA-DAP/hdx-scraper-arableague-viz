Through new partnerships, IOM will support vulnerable migrant communities in the government-run shelter and in the affected areas across Kuwait. IOM will further organize a number of events across the year to promote social cohesion among migrant workers and the host community. The events will create opportunities to build contact among residents and nationals; and highlight the growing contribution of migrants and migration to sustainable development and eliminate negative beliefs that hinder effective integration.
