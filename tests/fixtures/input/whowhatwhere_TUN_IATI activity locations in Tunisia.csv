Œ ŒZiel des FZ-Moduls ""Industrieabwasserentsorgung"" ist die adäquate Behandlung und Entsorgung industrieller Abwässer in bis zu 9 ausgewählten Industriezonen (IZ).

Dies soll mittelfristig zu einer verbesserten Wasserverfügbarkeit, vor allem in den benachteiligten, ländlichen Gebieten führen und dort einen Beitrag zur sozioökonomischen Entwicklung leisten. Gleichzeitig entlastet die verstärkte Oberflächenwassernutzung die Grundwasserressourcen (Ressourcenschutz). Œ ŒEin wesentliches Infrastrukturelement für eine integrierte Steuerung der Wassersysteme und ein interregionales Wassermanagement in Tunesien ist der bereits seit den 80er Jahren bestehende Kanal Medjerda - Cap Bon. Ein Teil des überschüssigen Wassers des Medjerdatals wird über diesen 120 km langen Kanal kontinuierlich in die landwirtschaftlich stark genutzte Region Cap Bon transferiert und dient dort der Bewässerung von ca. 19.000 ha landwirtschaftlicher Fläche. Das Wasser wird darüber hinaus für die Trinkwasserversorgung im Großraum Tunis, in der Region Cap Bon, in der Sahel-Region und dem Gouvernorat Sfax genutzt (ca. 5 Mio. Menschen). Auf Grund der landwirtschaftlichen Entwicklung der Region Cap Bon seit den 80er Jahren und der hierdurch dramatisch gestiegenen Wassernachfrage (im Jahre 1984 transferierte der Kanal jährlich 42 Mm³, 2013 waren es 341 Mm³ jährlich) sowie von in die Jahre gekommenen zentralen technischen Elementen des Kanals, drohen jedoch zunehmende Betriebspannen und das Risiko eines technischen Ausfalls des Kanals wächst. Œ ŒIm Rahmen des Projektes (Komponente des IWRM-Programms) werden zentrale Elemente des Kanals (u,a. Pumpstation Fondouk Jedid und Stauwehr Laroussia) rehabilitiert und in Wert gesetzt. Darüberhinaus wird über eine Fernsteuerung (télégestion) der zentralen Kanalschleusen die Durchflussgeschwindigkeit im Kanal erhöht, was zu einer direkten Verbesserung der Versorgungslage in der Cap Bon Region führt. Œ ŒDie KfW finanziert mit einem zinsverbilligten Darlehen in Höhe von 16 Mio. EUR ca. 70% der Investitionskosten. Der tunesische Staat leistet einen Eigenbeitrag von ca. 30% der Investitionskosten.

Le système administratif tunisien est organisé de manière particulièrement centralisée, avec peu de compétences au niveau local. Une partie importante du territoire national, notamment dans l'arrière-pays peu peuplé, a longtemps été dépourvu d´organisation formelle au niveau communal. La nouvelle constitution de 2014 a cependant consacré la volonté politique d'une plus forte autonomie des communes et a initié les réformes correspondantes. Œ ŒLe projet FICOL I comprend une mesure principale et une mesure d´accompagnement. L'objectif global du projet est de renforcer l'autonomie des municipalités nouvellement créées et étendues dans le cadre de la décentralisation, ainsi que leurs capacités à fournir des équipements et des services municipaux durables et adaptés aux besoins de la population. Ainsi, le projet contribue à soutenir le processus de réforme démocratique en Tunisie et à améliorer la situation socioéconomique de la population rurale.

The PACR consists of the construction of a 9 km-long twoway, two-lane (2x2) suburban highway on a new alignment bypassing the city of Bizerte to the southwest. Indeed and in line with the Bizerte Urban Development Master Plan, its implementation will help channel traffic away from the Bizerte city centre and will thus ease traffic congestion on the existing mobile bridge. The project will therefore help to promote intra- and inter-regional trade as well as reduce regional social disparities. Lastly, it will reduce accidents, CO2 emissions, improve the quality of life of the populations and facilitate access to social and economic centres.
